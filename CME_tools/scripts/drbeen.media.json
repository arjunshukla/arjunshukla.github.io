These 4 chambers are divided into 2 functional units referred to as the left heart and the right heart. These atria and ventricle in a single functional unit are separated by the atrioventricular valves. These AV valves are one way valves and allow blood flow in the forward direction only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right heart is formed by the right atrium and the right ventricle, and it forms one functional unit. The right atrium receives the venous deoxygenated blood from three sources, namely:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;Superior vena cava: brings deoxygenated blood from the head, neck and upper limb region</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;Inferior vena cava: brings deoxygenated blood from the lower extremities, the abdominal region and the rest of the body except the heart itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3)&nbsp;Coronary sinus: brings deoxygenated blood from the veins of the heart itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During diastole when the atria contract, this deoxygenated blood is pumped into the right ventricle. During systole, the right ventricle pumps this deoxygenated blood out of the heart and into the pulmonary circuit via the pulmonary artery*. The right heart plus the pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins together form the pulmonary circulation. The right side of the heart deals with deoxygenated blood only and it functions to send this deoxygenated blood to the pulmonary circulation to get oxygenated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Left heart forms another functional unit and consists of the left atrium and left ventricle. The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the pulmonary circuit via the 4 pulmonary veins*(two from each lung). When the atria contract, the left atrium pumps this oxygenated blood into the left ventricle. During systole, this oxygenated blood is pumped out of the heart via aorta, when the left ventricle contracts. The aorta then carries this oxygenated blood intothe systemic circulation. The left heart plus the systemic arteries (starting at the aorta), capillaries and veins together form the systemic circulation. For simplicity, it can be assumed that the left heart deals with the oxygenated blood and sends it to the systemic&nbsp;circulation&nbsp;via the aorta.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOTE: Arteries conduct blood away from the heart towards the tissues. Arteries normally carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, but an exception to this rule are the pulmonary arteries and&nbsp;the umbilical arteries(during fetal life only)&nbsp;which carry deoxygenated blood away from the heart and toward the lungs&nbsp;&amp; placenta respectively. Veins normally carry deoxygenated blood, except the pulmonary veins in adults&nbsp;and the umbilical vein (during fetal life only)&nbsp;which bring back oxygenated blood to the heart from the lungs&nbsp;and the placenta respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SYSTEMIC TISSUES:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the systemic perfusion, the oxygenated blood in the aorta is eventually transported to the following 6 major systemic tissues. These systemic tissues receive blood via a parallel system of arteries which originate at various levels from the aorta itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;Cerebral:&nbsp;The CNS plus the head &amp; neck region.&nbsp;15% of the cardiac output enters the cerebral arteries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;Coronary: The myocardium itself which receives oxygenated blood during diastole in contrast to the rest of the body which receives oxygenated blood as part of systole. 5% of the total cardiac output is designated for the myocardial perfusion via the kidneys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3)&nbsp;Splanchnic:&nbsp;The gastrointestinal system and its accessory organs such as the liver, spleen, pancreas&nbsp;and the biliary&nbsp;system.&nbsp;25% of the total cardiac output reaches the GIT system via the splanchnic arteries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4)&nbsp;Renal:&nbsp;The kidneys and the genitourinary system.&nbsp;Kidneys, as part of the renal system, receive 25% of the total cardiac output.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5)&nbsp;Skeletal:&nbsp;Roughly 25% of the total cardiac output is reaches the skeletal system. Exercise increases the percentage of cardiac output which is made available for the skeletal system.&nbsp;Bones and the musculature of the body form part of this system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6)&nbsp;Cutaneous:&nbsp;The skin and its associated structures (sebaceous glands, hair follicles). Around&nbsp;5% of the total cardiac output reaches the cutaneous circulation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BLOOD FLOW DIRECTION &amp; THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE VENOUS &amp; ARTERIAL BLOOD:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are 4 pulmonary veins which bring back oxygenated blood from the lungs to left atrium. This blood is rich in oxygen&nbsp;(PaO2=100 mm Hg)&nbsp;and low in carbon&nbsp;dioxide(PaCO2=40 mm Hg). The mitral valve which forms the left atrioventricular valve, allows passage of blood from the left atrium into the left ventricle during the diastole phase. When the left ventricle begins to contract and its pressure rises more than the left atrial pressure, the mitral valve closes to prevent backflow of the blood. This ensures anterograde flow of blood in to the aorta i.e., the forward direction of blood flow. Backflow from the aorta back into the left atrium is prevented by the semilunar aortic valve. It&#39;s important to remember that all the valves of the heart are tricuspid i.e., having three cusps, except the mitral valve which is bicuspid i.e., having two cusps. However, only the right atrioventricular valve is referred to as the tricuspid valve.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the aorta, the blood is transported to the systemic tissues which are mentioned above. The aorta divides into large and medium sized arteries, which eventually give arise the arterioles. The arterioles&nbsp;continue&nbsp;to form capillaries, and these capillaries merge together to form venules at their venous ends. The venules eventually end up forming the veins.&nbsp;The veins are low pressure vessels which return the deoxygenated blood back to the right heart via the three above mentioned sources&nbsp;of venous return to the heart. This deoxygenated blood is low in oxygen&nbsp;(40 mm Hg)&nbsp;and rich in carbon dioxide&nbsp;(47 mm Hg). The right atrioventricular valve, which is also referred to as the tricuspid valve, allows this deoxygenated blood to flow from the right atrium into the right ventricle. During ventricular systole when the leftventricle contracts, this&nbsp;deoxygenated blood is pumped out ofthe right side of the heart via the pulmonary artery. The backflow of this deoxygenated blood into the right side of the heart during ventricular diastole is prevented by the semilunar pulmonary valve. This deoxygenated blood reaches the lungs and enters the pulmonary circuit to get&nbsp;oxygenated&nbsp;At this point the blood completes&nbsp;its route both around the&nbsp;pulmonary and systemic circuits. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SERIES &amp; PARALLEL CIRCUITS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The right and left sides of the heart are connected&nbsp;in a series circuit&nbsp;to&nbsp;both&nbsp;the pulmonary and systemic tissues respectively. By series circuit, what&#39;s meant here is that quantitatively, the blood flow through the lungs is equal to the blood flow through the rest of the body. For simplicity in understanding, it should be considered that the lungs are connected to the rest of the body in a series&nbsp;circuit. During a single cardiac cycle, the right and left ventricular outputs are the same.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the blood supply of the systemic tissues is connected in a parallel circuit. This means that each organ system is supplied by an artery which originates as a branch of the aorta. This ensures that the blood which reaches a particular organ system is perfused at the same partial pressure of oxygen, as that of the site at which the branch originated&nbsp;from the aorta. If the organ systems were connected and perfused via a series circuit, by the time the blood reached the last organ system, it would have been completely depleted of oxygen and nutrients. The sum of blood flow to these individual systems adds up to the total left ventricular output (the cardiac output).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>VARIOUS PRESSURES IN THE CVS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (SBP):&nbsp;Systole is time interval when the ventricles are contracting. Systolic BP therefore is the pressure in the systemic arteries when the left ventricle is contracting. Therefore, SBP is the highest blood pressure in the systemic arteries during a cardiac cycle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Average SBP in healthy adults is 120 mm of Hg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;DIASTOLIC BLOOD&nbsp;PRESSURE (DBP):&nbsp;Diastole is the time interval when the ventricles are relaxing and therefore receiving blood from the atria. Diastolic BP is the pressure in the systemic arteries when the left ventricle is relaxing.&nbsp;DBP&nbsp;therefore is the lowest pressure in systemic arteries during a cardiac cycle. Average DBP in healthy adults is 80 mm of Hg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;PULSE PRESSURE&nbsp;(PP):&nbsp;This is the difference between the&nbsp;systolic&nbsp;blood pressure and the diastolic blood pressure in the systemic arteries at any given time. Pulse pressure can therefore be calculated as following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>➢&nbsp;Pulse pressure, PP = Difference between the systolic &amp; diastolic blood pressures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PP= SBP- DBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PP&nbsp;= 120-80= 40 mm of Hg</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Variations in pulse pressure can be in anaemia, fever, blood loss etc. Narrow pulse pressure can be seen when there is blood loss,&nbsp;aortic regurgitation. Pulse pressure widens during exercise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;MEAN ARTERIAL PRESSURE:&nbsp;MAP is the average arterial pressure of the systemic arteries. However,&nbsp;quantitatively&nbsp;it&#39;s not an&nbsp;arithmetic&nbsp;mean of the SBP &amp; DBP.&nbsp;Since the ventricular muscle spends 2/3 of the time of a cardiac cycle in diastole, the MAP is closer to the DBP, than it&#39;s to the SBP.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MAP signifies the perfusion pressure of the tissues. If the MAP of the patient decreases below 60 mm of Hg, then it should be a cause of concern for the doctor. What this signifies is that a perfusion pressure below 60 mm of Hg would not be able to meet the nutritional needs of the systemic tissues. So, the MAP, which is easier to calculate quantitatively, can be used in lieu of systemic perfusion pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>➢&nbsp;MAP = (CO x SVR) + CVP {CVP&nbsp;is negligible, so it can be ignored}</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, MAP = (CO&nbsp;X&nbsp;SVR)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SVR is the sum of resistance of all the vessels in the systemic circuit. However, the major component of systemic vascular resistance is the arteriolar resistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, MAP can be calculated by&nbsp;using&nbsp;the following formula if the SBP and DBP are known:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>➢&nbsp;MAP = DBP + 1/3 (SBP - DBP)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>{For&nbsp;a normal healthy adult, DBP = 120 &amp; SBP = 80}</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, MAP = 80 + 1/3 (120 - 80)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;MAP = 80 + 1/3 (40)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;MAP = 80 + 13.33</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;MAP = 93 mm of Hg (After rounding off)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternatively MAP can also be calculated by the following formula:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>➢&nbsp;MAP= 2/3 DBP + 1/3 SBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MAP= (2/3 x 80) + (1/3 x 120)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MAP= 53.33 + 40 = 93 mm of Hg</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;PERFUSION PRESSURE:&nbsp;The pressure necessary to bring blood supply to the systemic tissues to ensure their nutritional needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abbreviations:<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;SBP= systolic blood pressure</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;DBP=diastolic blood pressure</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;MAP=mean arterial pressure</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;PP= pulse pressure</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;CO=cardiac output</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;SVR=systemic vascular resistance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;CVP= central venous pressure</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "locales" : [ { "authToken" : "8c63bd321923dfb164d84f03e300076a", "referenceLocationId" : "12732912", "referenceToken" : "0c9376a44c7c82256e8a82ce3069bd05", "referenceId" : "13433937", "languageCode" : "en-US", "source" : "23video" } ], "tags" : { "section" : "Physiology", "topic" : [ "physiology", "", "Physiology", "CVS Physiology", "🔥Trending", "Cardiovascular System Clinical Foundations" ], "info" : [ "foundational", "usmleStep1", "special", "cme" ], "subject" : "Physiology", "system" : "Cardiovascular System", "concentrations" : [  ], "keywords" : [  ], "practice" : [  ] }, "packages" : [ "prohealth", "unlimited-cme", "unlimited-cme-intro", "student-monthly", "student-yearly", "student-coffee-2016", "student-beans-2016", "np-sprout-2016", "stgeorge-sprout-2016", "professional-monthly", "professional-yearly", "limited-student-lifetime", "lifetime-plan", "lifetime-access-special", "lifetime-access-promo", "lifetime-access", "drnajeeb-special", "stgeorge-coffee-2016", "np-coffee-2016", "stgeorge-bean-2016", "np-beans-2016", "al-ahli-hospital-pilot", "aanp-special-drnajeeb", "aanp-2017-yearly-access", "aanp-2017-lifetime-access", "free-trial-account", "USMLE-Step-1", "usmle-step-1", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-yearly-500", "lifetime-access-1", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-67", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-49", "lifetime-access-49", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-25", "lifetime-access-25", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "free-trial-account", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "monthly", "monthly", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "drbeen-gift", "drbeen-gift", "lifetime-access-67", "lifetime-access-67", "cvs-family-practice-package", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "yearly-special", "yearly-special", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "summer-discount", "summer-discount" ], "status" : "enabled", "slug" : "general-principles-of-hemodynamics-part-1", "seq" : 1, "updatedAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-12T17:00:01.223+0000" }, "instructors" : [ { "orderNum" : 1, "user" : { "$oid" : "57c6515c1a4f528e46bc4708" }, "role" : "lead" } ], "shortId" : "H1iMA_2lb", "access" : "freeForAll", "notes" : "<p>General principles of the CVS Organization Heart as two pumps Series and parallel circuits Chemical composition of the venous and arterial blood Blood flow direction Various pressures in the CVS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>STUDY NOTES:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CARDIOVASCULAR PHYSIOLOGY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ORGANIZATION OF THE CVS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HEART AS 2 PUMPS:&nbsp;The human heart has 4 chambers which are the two atria and the two ventricles.

So, the MAP, which is easier to calculate quantitatively, can be used in lieu of systemic perfusion pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>➢&nbsp;MAP = (CO x SVR) + CVP {CVP&nbsp;is negligible, so it can be ignored}</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, MAP = (CO&nbsp;X&nbsp;SVR)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SVR is the sum of resistance of all the vessels in the systemic circuit. However, the major component of systemic vascular resistance is the arteriolar resistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, MAP can be calculated by&nbsp;using&nbsp;the following formula if the SBP and DBP are known:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>➢&nbsp;MAP = DBP + 1/3 (SBP - DBP)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>{For&nbsp;a normal healthy adult, DBP = 120 &amp; SBP = 80}</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, MAP = 80 + 1/3 (120 - 80)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;MAP = 80 + 1/3 (40)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;MAP = 80 + 13.33</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;MAP = 93 mm of Hg (After rounding off)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternatively MAP can also be calculated by the following formula:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>➢&nbsp;MAP= 2/3 DBP + 1/3 SBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MAP= (2/3 x 80) + (1/3 x 120)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MAP= 53.33 + 40 = 93 mm of Hg</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;PERFUSION PRESSURE:&nbsp;The pressure necessary to bring blood supply to the systemic tissues to ensure their nutritional needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abbreviations:<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;SBP= systolic blood pressure</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;DBP=diastolic blood pressure</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;MAP=mean arterial pressure</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;PP= pulse pressure</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;CO=cardiac output</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;SVR=systemic vascular resistance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;CVP= central venous pressure</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "datePublished" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "createdAt" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "keywords" : [  ], "learningObjectives" : [  ], "ratings" : [  ], "__v" : 1 },

Change in the pressures with breathing and valsalva&#39;s manuver. Clinical points of the pulmonary vasculature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>STUDY NOTES:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PROPERTIES OF PULMONARY VASCULATURE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The heart pumps a volume of blood into the lungs which after getting oxygenated is transported back to heart. This oxygenated blood is then pumped out of the heart and into the aorta and subsequently into the systemic circulation. As a consequence, at any given time the lungs (pulmonary vasculature) contain around 500ml of blood, thereby allowing them to function as a reservoir of the blood. This reservoir volume is increased by&nbsp;another<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>&nbsp;500 ml when the person is in the supine&nbsp;or lying down&nbsp;position. This is because in supine position there&#39;s an increased venous return (due to the effect of gravity) to the right heart from the peripheries and therefore more blood accumulates in the central parts of body. Upon standing up, this extra 500ml of blood gets redistributed&nbsp;under the effect of gravity, to the now more dependent parts of the body which includes the peripheral tissues and the lower extremities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The division of vasculature in the pulmonary circuit is somewhat different from that in the systemic circulation. The arteries in the pulmonary circuit divide in a binary fashion, thereby following the pattern of division of the airways. The veins too exhibit a pattern similar to the arterioles and the bronchioles, thereby finally converging into forming one large pulmonary vein. These pulmonary veins transport the oxygenated blood back to the heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from the primary function of lungs to deliver oxygenated blood to the heart, it has several secondary functions as well:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;Filtration:&nbsp;Pulmonary vascular bed acts as a filter for the blood received by the right side of the heart&nbsp;andbefore this blood leaves the left side of the heart&nbsp;to enter the systemic circulation. Blood arriving from the right side of the heart to the lungs may contain an embolus or a thrombus or any foreign particle that may result in obstruction of the vessels. The pulmonary artery divides into numerous small&nbsp;capillaries&nbsp;with diameters too&nbsp;small to allow passage of any&nbsp;dislodged particles&nbsp;into the pulmonary artery and subsequently in to the left side of the heart. Therefore, the pulmonary vascular bed acts as a filtration barrier that prevents introduction of any particles into the systemic circulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;Metabolic Functions:&nbsp;The pulmonary vasculature also has some metabolic functions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a)&nbsp;The endothelium of the pulmonary vessels is lined by fibrinolytic enzymes that cause lysis of the fibrin clots which get stuck in the pulmonary vasculature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b)&nbsp;The pulmonary capillary endothelium is lined by another enzyme as well. This enzyme is called the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE). ACE functions to convert Angiotensin I&nbsp;to Angiotensin II. ACE is also present in the endothelium of other vascular beds and the plasma, however, the amount present in the pulmonary vascular bed is the highest. &nbsp;ACE within the pulmonary vascular bed is responsible for more&nbsp;than 70% of the total conversion of Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II in the body.</p>\r\n", "locales" : [ { "languageCode" : "en-us", "source" : "23video", "referenceId" : "13434015", "referenceToken" : "449b88f2f8dc2f737990249e60282efb", "referenceLocationId" : "12732914", "authToken" : "3a889092856caf79358c47ce9903e3b1" } ], "tags" : { "section" : "Physiology", "topic" : [ "physiology", "", "Physiology", "CVS Physiology", "Cardiovascular System Clinical Foundations" ], "info" : [ "foundational", "usmleStep1", "special", "cme" ], "subject" : "Physiology", "system" : "Cardiovascular System", "concentrations" : [  ], "keywords" : [  ], "practice" : [  ] }, "packages" : [ "prohealth", "drbeen-yearly-discount", "drbeen-yearly", "unlimited-cme", "unlimited-cme-intro", "unlimited-cme-uaprn", "uaprn-conference", "student-monthly", "student-yearly", "student-coffee-2016", "student-beans-2016", "np-sprout-2016", "stgeorge-sprout-2016", "professional-monthly", "professional-yearly", "drbeen-monthly", "limited-student-lifetime", "lifetime-plan", "lifetime-access-special", "lifetime-access-half-price", "lifetime-access-discount", "lifetime-access-promo", "lifetime-access", "lifetime-access-49", "drnajeeb-special", "drnajeeb-cme", "stgeorge-coffee-2016", "np-coffee-2016", "stgeorge-bean-2016", "np-beans-2016", "al-ahli-hospital-pilot", "aanp-special-drnajeeb", "aanp-2017-yearly-access", "aanp-2017-lifetime-access", "monthly", "yearly", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-electives", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "usmle-step-1", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-79", "drbeen-yearly-49", "lifetime-access-1", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-67", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "lifetime-access-27", "drbeen-quarterly", "lifetime-discounted-50", "db-a-lifetime", "drbeen-uaprn", "db-uaprn-2018", "sellular-access", "special-been", "nc-been", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-49", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "free-trial-h", "student-monthly-22", "student-lifetime-access", "promotional-been", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-25", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "monthly", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "drbeen-gift", "lifetime-access-67", "cvs-family-practice-package", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "yearly-special", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "summer-discount", "summer-discount" ], "status" : "enabled", "slug" : "pulmonary-vascular-circuit-changes-under-varying-conditions", "seq" : 3, "updatedAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-12T17:00:01.227+0000" }, "instructors" : [ { "orderNum" : 1, "user" : { "$oid" : "57c6515c1a4f528e46bc4708" }, "role" : "lead" } ], "shortId" : "HyZif0u2eW", "access" : "subscription", "datePublished" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "createdAt" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "keywords" : [  ], "learningObjectives" : [  ], "ratings" : [  ], "__v" : 1 },

This is because the cross sectional area of all the capillaries when&nbsp;summated becomes equal to 3000cm^2, a value which is 1000 folds greater than the cross&nbsp;sectional area of aorta. Following calculations can be used to calculate velocity of blood flowing through the aorta and the capillaries respectively:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Velocity of the blood flow through Aorta:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>➢&nbsp;​&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>=&nbsp;{ml and cm^3 can be substituted interchangeably}</p>\r\n\r\n<p>=</p>\r\n\r\n<p>= 2000 cm/min</p>\r\n\r\n<p>= 20 m/min</p>\r\n\r\n<p>= 33 cm/s</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Velocity of the blood&nbsp;flow through the Capillaries:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>➢&nbsp;​&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>=&nbsp;&nbsp;{ml and cm^3 can be substituted interchangeably}</p>\r\n\r\n<p>=&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>= 1.6 cm/min</p>\r\n\r\n<p>= 0.016 m/min</p>\r\n\r\n<p>= 0.027 cm/s</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To summarize, the aorta acts as a conducting vessel as it conducts blood at high velocity to the rest of the body.

If a cylinder is cut at normal (right angle) and the cross section viewed, it will appear as a circle. The area of a circle is calculated by the formula, (). The radius of the circle is determined by measuring the length from the centre of circle to any point along its circumference. The unit for the cross sectional area is cm^2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Velocity vs. Flow</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Velocity&nbsp;is defined as the distance covered in unit time (cm/s). For simplicity, velocity is defined as the speed of movement of a particle. Velocity of a particle in a fluid is independent of the total volume of the fluid itself. The velocity of the blood is equal to the distance it covers in unit time, irrespective of the volume moved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flow&nbsp;however is dependant of the fluid volume. Flow refers to the volume of fluid that passes through a cross sectional area in unit time. With respect to hemodynamics, flow is measured as the volume of blood that passes through a particular area in unit time (ml/min).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Formulae:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>➢&nbsp;Velocity (cm/s) = Flow/Cross Sectional Area&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= Q/A (Unit: [ml/m]/cm^2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Assumptions: For the purpose of this lecture, the flow of blood in an average, healthy adult is assumed as 5L/min, which is also the cardiac output.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After being pumped from the heart, the blood first flows into the aorta and then into the major arteries. From there, the blood enters arterioles of the respective functional organ systems. The arterioles divide into small&nbsp;capillaries&nbsp;which anastomose with&nbsp;capillaries&nbsp;of the venules within the organ system. The venules empty into veins and the veins after collecting blood from all parts of the body, empty into the Superior and Inferior Vena Cava which deliver the blood back to the heart, completing the circuit. Together these components of the systemic vasculature form a closed circuit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, the cross sectional area of the vessels changes as the blood flows through the body with subsequent changes in the velocity as well. According to the formula devised earlier, the velocity of blood is inversely proportional to the diameter of the blood vessel, given that the flow rate remains constant. For example, the aorta has the smallest diameter and a cross sectional area of 2.5cm^2. In a healthy individual, the velocity of blood in the aorta can be calculated by dividing the flow rate&nbsp;(approximated earlier as 5000ml) by the cross sectional area (2.5cm^2) of the vessel. This would give a value for the velocity of blood flowing through the aorta as 20 meters/min. The calculation for the velocity of blood flowing through the aorta is summarized below:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>➢&nbsp;Cross-sectional area of Aorta = 2.5cm^2</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= 2.5cm^2</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Diameter of Aorta = 1.78cm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>➢&nbsp;Velocity of the blood flow through Aorta:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>​&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>=&nbsp;&nbsp;{ml and cm^3 can be substituted interchangeably}</p>\r\n\r\n<p>=&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>= 2000 cm/min</p>\r\n\r\n<p>= 20 m/min</p>\r\n\r\n<p>= 33 cm/s</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before moving on, it should be noted that the diameter, and hence the cross sectional area, of the branching arteries is taken as the sum of all the arteries at that level and not of a single artery individually. &nbsp;The capillaries, as a result, have a collective cross sectional area of 3000cm^2, a value which is 1000 folds greater than the cross sectional area of the aorta. Hence, the velocity of the blood drops considerably (1.6cm/min) as it reaches the capillaries. The calculation for the velocity of blood flowing through the capillaries is summarized below:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>➢&nbsp;Total Cross-sectional area of Capillaries = 3000cm^2</p>\r\n\r\n<p>➢&nbsp;Velocity of the blood flow through the Capillaries:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>​&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>=&nbsp;&nbsp;{ml and cm^3 can be substituted interchangeably}</p>\r\n\r\n<p>=&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>= 1.6 cm/min</p>\r\n\r\n<p>= 0.016 m/min</p>\r\n\r\n<p>= 0.027 cm/s</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The significance of these large differences in velocities is immense. The aorta is functionally a conducting vessel; therefore it contains blood travelling at a relatively high velocity so that the blood can reach the desired target organs efficiently. In contrast, the velocity of the blood drops significantly (1.6cm/min) as it reaches the capillaries. Therefore, the capillaries contain the blood with minimal velocity which allows for efficient exchange of gases and transport of nutrients and waste products across&nbsp;them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "locales" : [ { "languageCode" : "en-us", "source" : "23video", "referenceId" : "13433974", "referenceToken" : "281772b04389170b755f28295ce54e12", "referenceLocationId" : "12732914", "authToken" : "ba563cbfd7c0b8d34a49e97426e74b44" } ], "tags" : { "section" : "Physiology", "topic" : [ "physiology", "", "Physiology", "CVS Physiology", "Cardiovascular System Clinical Foundations" ], "info" : [ "foundational", "usmleStep1", "special", "cme" ], "subject" : "Physiology", "system" : "Cardiovascular System", "concentrations" : [  ], "keywords" : [  ], "practice" : [  ] }, "packages" : [ "prohealth", "drbeen-yearly-discount", "drbeen-yearly", "unlimited-cme", "unlimited-cme-intro", "unlimited-cme-uaprn", "uaprn-conference", "student-monthly", "student-yearly", "student-coffee-2016", "student-beans-2016", "np-sprout-2016", "stgeorge-sprout-2016", "professional-monthly", "professional-yearly", "drbeen-monthly", "limited-student-lifetime", "lifetime-plan", "lifetime-access-special", "lifetime-access-half-price", "lifetime-access-discount", "lifetime-access-promo", "lifetime-access", "lifetime-access-49", "drnajeeb-special", "drnajeeb-cme", "stgeorge-coffee-2016", "np-coffee-2016", "stgeorge-bean-2016", "np-beans-2016", "al-ahli-hospital-pilot", "aanp-special-drnajeeb", "aanp-2017-yearly-access", "aanp-2017-lifetime-access", "monthly", "yearly", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-electives", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "usmle-step-1", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-79", "drbeen-yearly-49", "lifetime-access-1", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-67", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "lifetime-access-27", "drbeen-quarterly", "lifetime-discounted-50", "db-a-lifetime", "drbeen-uaprn", "db-uaprn-2018", "sellular-access", "special-been", "nc-been", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-49", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "free-trial-h", "student-monthly-22", "student-lifetime-access", "promotional-been", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-25", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "monthly", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "drbeen-gift", "lifetime-access-67", "cvs-family-practice-package", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "yearly-special", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "summer-discount", "summer-discount" ], "status" : "enabled", "slug" : "blood-flow-hemodynamics", "seq" : 6, "updatedAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-12T17:00:01.225+0000" }, "instructors" : [ { "orderNum" : 1, "user" : { "$oid" : "57c6515c1a4f528e46bc4708" }, "role" : "lead" } ], "shortId" : "rJNofC_nlZ", "access" : "subscription", "datePublished" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "createdAt" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "keywords" : [  ], "learningObjectives" : [  ], "ratings" : [  ], "__v" : 1 },

This means that increasing the viscosity of blood will result in an increase in resistance. Blood viscosity undergoes changes with alterations in the hematocrit. Hematocrit is the percentage of total number of particulate matter (RBCs, WBCs, proteins etc) in a given volume of blood. Under normal conditions, the value of&nbsp;hematocrit&nbsp;is 45%.&nbsp;Changes in the hematocrit can occur with both,&nbsp;physiological&nbsp;and pathological conditions. Dehydration causes decrease in the volume of blood which results in a relative physiological increase in hematocrit. Similarly, secondary polycythemia also causes physiological increase in the value of hematocrit as a result of increased production of red blood cells by the bone marrow. Pathological increase in the hematocrit is primarily seen in malignancy of the bone mar<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>row in which large&nbsp;numbers of undifferentiated cells areproduced leading to an increase in the cell number. Multiple Myeloma is the neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells which produce excess immunoglobulins. This results in an increased protein&nbsp;content of the blood and a resultant&nbsp;increase in hematocrit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, anemia will cause a decrease in hematocrit and hence, a decrease in viscosity of blood. As mentioned earlier,&nbsp;a&nbsp;decrease in&nbsp;blood viscosity will result in&nbsp;a decrease in&nbsp;resistance&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;flow of blood.&nbsp;Flow rate increases when there&rsquo;s a decrease in resistance offered to blood flow. Increase in&nbsp;the flow rate&nbsp;can be problematic because it generates&nbsp;Eddy currents within the blood vessels. These Eddy currents cause pressure damage to the blood vessel and cause the blood flow to become turbulent. Turbulent blood flow&nbsp;within the heart results in murmurs.&nbsp;Turbulent blood flow within the blood vessels results in bruit. Most common sites of bruit are carotid artery and the aorta. Both murmur and bruit can be appreciated upon auscultation at the relevant sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The resistance to blood flow within the blood vessel is inversely proportional to the&nbsp;radius&nbsp;of the blood vessel raised to the fourth power.&nbsp;If&nbsp;the&nbsp;cross sectional area&nbsp;of thecylindrical&nbsp;blood vessel&nbsp;is decreased, there&rsquo;s a resultant increase in&nbsp;resistance&nbsp;to blood flow in that vessel. So that basically means, if we take the radius and simply divide it by two&nbsp;(decreasing the radius of the vessel to half), the&nbsp;resistancewould increase by a factor of 16. This would result in a considerable decrease in the flow rate of the blood. Application of this concept is seen in pathological cases, such as the narrowing of blood vessels in atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis, resulting in increased&nbsp;resistance&nbsp;and reduced blood flow. The diameter of blood vessels in our body is physiologically controlled by our body&#39;s autonomic nervous system&nbsp;(ANS). Arterioles are the vessels in which the autonomic effects are seen most prominently. For this reason they are also known as the&nbsp;resistance&nbsp;vessels or&nbsp;the functional sphincters of the cardiovascular system. The smooth muscles&nbsp;surrounding&nbsp;the arterioles contract or relax under the effect of the autonomic nervous system. When stimulated by the sympathetic nervous&nbsp;system (SANS), the alpha 1 receptors&nbsp;on the arteriolar smooth muscle&nbsp;get activated.&nbsp;These receptors are coupled intracellularly with Gq proteins which get activated and increase intracellular levels of second messengers, namely IP3 and DAG. The second messengers cause movement of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum resulting in contraction of the smooth muscles. The same sympathetic innervation when stimulates the Beta 2&nbsp;adrenergic&nbsp;receptors on the arteriolar smooth muscle of&nbsp;arterioles perfusing&nbsp;skeletal muscles,&nbsp;a&nbsp;Gi&nbsp;coupled response is initiated. This will cause a decrease in&nbsp;cAMP&nbsp;levels in smooth muscle cells of the arterioles. As a consequence, the smooth muscle will relax and the arteriole will dilate allowing more blood to perfuse the skeletal muscles.&nbsp;The distribution of extracellular receptors (beta 2, alpha 1, etc) on vascular smooth muscles depends on the demand for blood by different organs according to the situation.&nbsp;For example, during a fight and flight&nbsp;response, the blood vessels of the skeletal smooth&nbsp;muscles&nbsp;(innervated by beta 2 receptors) will dilate to provide more blood to the muscles. At the same time, the vascular&nbsp;smooth muscles of arterioles perfusing the visceras&nbsp;(GIT, Kidneys, etc) will contract, and the lumen will constrict in order for the blood to redirect to parts where it is needed more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USE OF POISUILLES EQUATION IN THE FLOW EQUATION</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The value of the&nbsp;resistance,&nbsp;calculated&nbsp;using the&nbsp;POISUILLES EQUATION,&nbsp;can&nbsp;be plugged into the flow equation (given below) to&nbsp;determine the flow rate:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>➢&nbsp;Flow = &Delta;P/R,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&Delta;P = MAP - Right Atrial Pressure</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flow = (MAP - RAP) /Resistance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&Delta;P: change in Pressure</p>\r\n\r\n<p>R:&nbsp;Resistance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MAP: Mean Arterial Pressure</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, according to the equation, increase in&nbsp;resistance&nbsp;will cause a decrease in the flow of blood through a vessel. The&nbsp;resistance&nbsp;of a blood vessel is increased in conditions such as atherosclerosis and vasospasm due to increased sympathetic activity. Similarly, if the resistance is decreased, the flow of blood through a vessel will increase.</p>\r\n", "locales" : [ { "languageCode" : "en-us", "source" : "23video", "referenceId" : "13433975", "referenceToken" : "7e4bdced9489d414b094fc47c414ea85", "referenceLocationId" : "12732918", "authToken" : "b7d4b6778d79158e1cf096171fb03bf5" } ], "tags" : { "section" : "Physiology", "topic" : [ "physiology", "", "Physiology", "CVS Physiology", "Cardiovascular System Clinical Foundations" ], "info" : [ "foundational", "usmleStep1", "special", "cme" ], "subject" : "Physiology", "system" : "Cardiovascular System", "concentrations" : [  ], "keywords" : [  ], "practice" : [  ] }, "packages" : [ "prohealth", "drbeen-yearly-discount", "drbeen-yearly", "unlimited-cme", "unlimited-cme-intro", "unlimited-cme-uaprn", "uaprn-conference", "student-monthly", "student-yearly", "student-coffee-2016", "student-beans-2016", "np-sprout-2016", "stgeorge-sprout-2016", "professional-monthly", "professional-yearly", "drbeen-monthly", "limited-student-lifetime", "lifetime-plan", "lifetime-access-special", "lifetime-access-half-price", "lifetime-access-discount", "lifetime-access-promo", "lifetime-access", "lifetime-access-49", "drnajeeb-special", "drnajeeb-cme", "stgeorge-coffee-2016", "np-coffee-2016", "stgeorge-bean-2016", "np-beans-2016", "al-ahli-hospital-pilot", "aanp-special-drnajeeb", "aanp-2017-yearly-access", "aanp-2017-lifetime-access", "monthly", "yearly", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-electives", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "usmle-step-1", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-79", "drbeen-yearly-49", "lifetime-access-1", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-67", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "lifetime-access-27", "drbeen-quarterly", "lifetime-discounted-50", "db-a-lifetime", "drbeen-uaprn", "db-uaprn-2018", "sellular-access", "special-been", "nc-been", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-49", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "free-trial-h", "student-monthly-22", "student-lifetime-access", "promotional-been", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-25", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "monthly", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "drbeen-gift", "lifetime-access-67", "cvs-family-practice-package", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "yearly-special", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "summer-discount", "summer-discount" ], "status" : "enabled", "slug" : "poiseuilles-equation", "seq" : 7, "updatedAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-12T17:00:01.225+0000" }, "instructors" : [ { "orderNum" : 1, "user" : { "$oid" : "57c6515c1a4f528e46bc4708" }, "role" : "lead" } ], "shortId" : "SJHiMCd2xb", "access" : "subscription", "datePublished" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "createdAt" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "keywords" : [  ], "learningObjectives" : [  ], "ratings" : [  ], "__v" : 1 },

Take for example&nbsp;the aorta; it has the most layers&nbsp;(around 50 layers)&nbsp;of elastin fibers in its tunica media which makes it the most elastic blood vessel in the body. If the aorta is compressed or stretched, it will recoil back to its normal shape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compliance&nbsp;of a vessel is the opposite of its elastance. The veins are said to be compliant because if you keep increasing the volume of blood in the veins, their&nbsp;walls will distend allowing for more blood to&nbsp;be&nbsp;accommodated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arteries and veins possess relative percentage of both, elasticity and compliance. However, arteries are said to berelatively&nbsp;more elastic and less compliant owing to the fact that they have more elastic fibers. This explains why the aorta resists distension when blood at high pressure is pumped into it by the heart. The increase in pressure causes a small stretch in the wall (due to compliance) of aorta which is immediately diffused as the aorta recoils back (due to elasticity) to its original shape.&nbsp;Greater the amount of elastic tissue in a vessel wall, the higher is the elastance, and the lower is the compliance of the blood vessel.&nbsp;As the person&rsquo;s age increases, the arteries become stiffer and further lose their compliance. Pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis also further decreases the arterial compliance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The opposite is true for the veins. The walls of the veins, being very compliant, will keep on stretching as more blood is added to the veins. There will be a small degree of recoil as well but the resultant force is not as strong as that in the arteries.Formulae:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>➢&nbsp;Compliance = Volume (ml)/ Pressure (mm Hg)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As seen in the formula, compliance can be written as a ratio of volume and pressure. This shows that more compliant vessels will allow more volume of blood to be added without causing any changes in pressure. On the other hand, the arteries try to resist changes in volume by generating more pressure as they are less compliant. This is the reason why the volume of blood in arteries is called&nbsp;stressed&nbsp;volume&nbsp;whereas&nbsp;the volume in veins is called&nbsp;unstressed&nbsp;volume.&nbsp;. Systemic veins are 20 times more compliant relative to systemic arteries.&nbsp;Due to this, the&nbsp;veins&nbsp;easily&nbsp;distend in response to high volumes of blood. Because of their ability to capacitate, the veins accommodate roughly 70% of the systemic blood volume. For this reason the systemic veins are a major blood&nbsp;reservoir of the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The table below contrasts the different properties of arteries and veins and the effect they have on hemodynamics.

This property makes up the basis for &ldquo;&nbsp;windkessel&nbsp;effect&rdquo;&nbsp;in the aorta. The aorta distends in response to the high pressure blood pumped by the heart and recoils back thereby maintaining the pressure between 120/80 mm Hg. The elastance of veins is low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Stress: The arteries face stress as the blood running in them is at high pressure. The stress&nbsp;<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>on the walls of the veins is negligible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Volume: The arteries are not capable of housing large volumes of blood. The veins have more capacity as they are more distensible and compliant in the face of volume changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Pressure: The pressure in the arteries is greater than that in the veins.&nbsp;Arterial wall recoils due to presence of elastic fibers, and this recoil is responsible for the arterial pressure. Veins on the other hand don&rsquo;t have that much of an elastic component and therefore lack recoil ability and consequently the blood pressure is relatively low in the veins.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Flow: The flow is equal in both, the arteries and the veins, as the blood is flowing in a closed circuit.&nbsp;As the blood moves in a closed circuit, the flow is equal at all points.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMPLIANCE GRAPHS FOR VOLUME VS PRESSURE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>X-axis = Volume (mL)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Y-axis = Pressure (mm Hg)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The graphs in the lecture compare the compliance of aorta with that of systemic veins. For understanding purpose, compliance can be referred to as the pressure change in the blood vessel when unit volume of blood is added to the vessel (aorta or the veins). The compliance of each vessel can be calculated as the gradient of the graph at any point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compliance = &Delta;V/&Delta;P</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Aorta, when unit volume&nbsp;of blood&nbsp;is added to it, there&rsquo;s a significant rise in its pressure.&nbsp;The gradient of the volume vs. pressure curve is relatively less steep. This suggests that the aorta has a low compliance. Increase in pressure can also be explained by the greater recoil (elastance) of the aorta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For veins, when blood is added to them, there&rsquo;s no significant change in pressure. The gradient of the volume vs. pressure is very steep, which suggests that their compliance is very high.&nbsp;The veins can hold greater volume of blood without any increase in their pressure because they are very distensible.However, as we continue to add blood, there comes a point when the curve starts to flatten out and the vein cannot accommodate any more blood. The compliance at this point is zero.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "locales" : [ { "languageCode" : "en-us", "source" : "23video", "referenceId" : "13434047", "referenceToken" : "976660fe7a6760eef712ebba4d3598b6", "referenceLocationId" : "12732914", "authToken" : "64d8b32b7deee4dc2a98cf6ee038c57f" } ], "tags" : { "section" : "Physiology", "topic" : [ "physiology", "", "Physiology", "CVS Physiology", "Cardiovascular System Clinical Foundations" ], "info" : [ "foundational", "usmleStep1", "special", "cme" ], "subject" : "Physiology", "system" : "Cardiovascular System", "concentrations" : [  ], "keywords" : [  ], "practice" : [  ] }, "packages" : [ "prohealth", "drbeen-yearly-discount", "drbeen-yearly", "unlimited-cme", "unlimited-cme-intro", "unlimited-cme-uaprn", "uaprn-conference", "student-monthly", "student-yearly", "student-coffee-2016", "student-beans-2016", "np-sprout-2016", "stgeorge-sprout-2016", "professional-monthly", "professional-yearly", "drbeen-monthly", "limited-student-lifetime", "lifetime-plan", "lifetime-access-special", "lifetime-access-half-price", "lifetime-access-discount", "lifetime-access-promo", "lifetime-access", "lifetime-access-49", "drnajeeb-special", "drnajeeb-cme", "stgeorge-coffee-2016", "np-coffee-2016", "stgeorge-bean-2016", "np-beans-2016", "al-ahli-hospital-pilot", "aanp-special-drnajeeb", "aanp-2017-yearly-access", "aanp-2017-lifetime-access", "monthly", "yearly", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-electives", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "usmle-step-1", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-79", "drbeen-yearly-49", "lifetime-access-1", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-67", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "lifetime-access-27", "drbeen-quarterly", "lifetime-discounted-50", "db-a-lifetime", "drbeen-uaprn", "db-uaprn-2018", "sellular-access", "special-been", "nc-been", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-49", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "free-trial-h", "student-monthly-22", "student-lifetime-access", "promotional-been", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-25", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "monthly", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "drbeen-gift", "lifetime-access-67", "cvs-family-practice-package", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "yearly-special", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "summer-discount", "summer-discount" ], "status" : "enabled", "slug" : "vascular-compliance", "seq" : 8, "updatedAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-12T17:00:01.226+0000" }, "instructors" : [ { "orderNum" : 1, "user" : { "$oid" : "57c6515c1a4f528e46bc4708" }, "role" : "lead" } ], "shortId" : "S1IsMRd2xW", "access" : "subscription", "datePublished" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "createdAt" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "keywords" : [  ], "learningObjectives" : [  ], "ratings" : [  ], "__v" : 1 },

There are two types of blood flow:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Laminar Flow: The laminar flow is described as the flow of fluid which is travelling in a calm, layered fashion. The layer of fluid flowing in the center most region of the blood vessel is said to have the highest velocity. Moving peripherally, the velocity of the layers decrease and the outer most layer, which is running along the vessel wall, is said to be travelling with the lowest velocity. This is due to friction which results in a backward drag produced by the wall on the layer adjacent to it. It is important for a blood vessel to exhibit laminar flow in order to maintain its physical integrity and carry out various cardiovascular functions. Laminar flow allows margination to occur efficiently among other functions. Margination is the process of adherence of blood cells to the vessel wall and their subsequent exit through the wall of the blood vessel to areas of need. This process gets largely disrupted if blood flow is not laminar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Turbulent Flow: Blood flowing&nbsp;viciously and in ahaphazard fashion produces turbulence within a blood vessel. The aorta normally contains blood with turbulent flow. This type of blood flow results in the production of Eddy currents within a blood vessel. These currents cause the blood to hit against the vessel wall with considerable amount of force. Repeated impaction of high pressure, turbulent blood on the vessel wall damages the elastic fibers within the tunica media. As a consequence, the elastic fibers break into smaller fragments, rendering the fibers non functional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A small Reynolds&nbsp;number signifies that the blood is flowing in&nbsp;a smooth and&nbsp;laminar fashion. If the Reynolds number is high, the blood flowing through the blood vessel would be turbulent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Murmurs and bruits point to the presence of turbulence in blood flow. These can be appreciated upon auscultation at the relevant areas.&nbsp;Murmurs are sounds of blood splattering on the rest of the blood due to turbulence. These disturbances result in vibrations that resonate through the walls of blood vessels or the heart itself. These are picked up as distinct sounds upon auscultation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>➢&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The formula says that the value of Reynolds number is directly proportional to&nbsp;density&nbsp;of the blood, the blood&#39;s&nbsp;velocity&nbsp;and the&nbsp;diameter&nbsp;of the blood vessel. Increasing the magnitude of any of these parameters will result in an increase in Reynolds number,&nbsp;and add turbulence to the blood flow. Therefore, the aorta having the largest diameter compared to the rest of blood vessels, and the highest rate of blood flow, will give a large Reynolds number. Hence, the flow is turbulent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The viscosity of blood has&nbsp;an inverse relationship with theReynolds number. Increased&nbsp;viscosity of a fluid results in its flow becoming more laminar.&nbsp;Increased viscosity will also decrease the velocity of the blood flow.&nbsp;Similarly, decreasing the viscosity of the&nbsp;fluid will result in more&nbsp;vicious&nbsp;and&nbsp;turbulent flow.

Role of the blood vessels in the blood flow including ERDF and Endothelin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CVS&nbsp;PHYSIOLOGY LECTURE # 9 STUDY NOTES:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUTOREGULATION OF BLOOD FLOW</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we talk about autoregulation, it&#39;s not the blood pressure we are talking about but it&#39;s rather the blood flow over a changing pressure which is being regulated. In terms of hemodynamics, the flow across a blood vessel is determined by the pressure gradient across its two ends, assuming that the vessel diameter (resistance) remains unchanged.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The equation for blood flow across a vessel is as following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>➢&nbsp;Flow = &Delta;P/ R</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flow = [P1 - P2]/ R</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&Delta;P = Pressure gradient</p>\r\n\r\n<p>R &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = Resistance to blood flow across the vessel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blood flow change can occur if any of the following factors change:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Blood volume</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Vessel diameter&nbsp;i.e., the resistance to blood flow changes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s important to understand that any pressure changes of the blood result in flow changes across capillaries supplying blood to the tissues. If the flow changes, there can be derangements in the perfusion of the tissues. One of the major functions of cardiovascular system is to provide optimal perfusion to the tissues. Perfusion ensures optimal delivery of nutrients and oxygen and removal of metabolic waste products from the tissues. So for this reason, if there are any pressure changes then the body will try to regulate the blood flow accordingly in order to maintain optimal perfusion of the systemic tissues.&nbsp;So it&#39;s safe to assume that it is&nbsp;the blood flow which is regulated as part of hemodynamics, not the vascular resistance (arteriolar diameter). In fact, vascular resistance is altered in order to regulate blood flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Autoregulating tissues&nbsp;are those which exhibit local blood flow regulation, thereby maintaining a constant blood flow even if the perfusion pressure changes (MAP). The blood pressure range over which an autoregulating tissue can maintain a constant blood flow is called the autoregulatory range. The&nbsp;autoregulatory&nbsp;range in our body is from a MAP of 70 mm of Hg to 175 mm of Hg. Outside the autoregulatory range (MAP &lt; 70 and MAP &gt; 175), the flow doesn&#39;t remain constant. There is a proportional decrease or increase in flow if the MAP falls below 70 mm Hg or increases above 175 mm Hg, respectively.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following is a brief summary of what&#39;s happening to the flow at&nbsp;points A,&nbsp;B &amp; C&nbsp;on the autoregulation graph in drawn in the lecture:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Point A: This point falls outside the lower limit of autoregulatory range (MAP &lt; 70). Up till point A, as the MAP increases from 0 to 70 mm Hg, the blood vessel is maximally dil<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>ated. The blood vessel is as relaxed as possible and as the blood flow through it increases, there&#39;s a proportional increase in the blood pressure of the vessel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Point B: This point falls within the autoregulatory range. The increased blood pressure resulting from an increased flow results in smooth muscle contraction of the vessel. This reduces the diameter of the blood vessel and the flow is kept constant. The blood vessel continues to constrict until the upper limit of the autoregulatory range is reached&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(MAP = 175).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Point C: This point falls outside the upper limit of autoregulatory range (MAP &gt; 175). Outside this range, the vasculature can&#39;t constrict any further so the blood flow can&#39;t be kept constant anymore. Hence, any further increase in the blood pressure will always be accompanied by an increase in blood flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOTE:&nbsp;The blood flow is primarily governed by dilating or constricting the smooth muscle within the walls of the arterioles, provided that other factors such as viscosity of blood, blood volume and other physiological factors are kept constant.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several&nbsp;types of blood flow regulations:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;Long term regulation: This is done by&nbsp;achieved&nbsp;by increasing the size and diameter plus increasing the number of blood vessels. It can take from months to years to achieve such kind of a change. This long term blood flow regulation will later be discussed in a separate lecture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;Acute regulation: This responds to the local needs of a metabolically active tissue. Only those tissues which require greater blood flow owing to their metabolic activity receive a greater blood flow. This ensures that the blood flow to whole of the body is not increased if a particular tissue needs more perfusion. Overall, this makes sure that the workload on the heart doesn&#39;t increase too much. Acute regulation of blood flow is further divided into the following types:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Extrinsic regulation&nbsp;involves SANS and PANS input to regulate vascular diameter. Extrinsic regulation will be discussed later in a separate lecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Intrinsic regulation&nbsp;involves mediators released from the tissue itself which ensure that adequate perfusion to the tissue is maintained. Autoregulating tissues fall under this category of tissues which have their perfusion regulated by the tissue itself, and examples of these are as following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>▪&nbsp;Cerebral circulation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>▪&nbsp;Coronary circulation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>▪&nbsp;Skeletal muscle vasculature (during exercise)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>▪&nbsp;Renal Circulation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two major mechanisms which are used toexplain intrinsic regulation&nbsp;(autoregulation). These include the metabolic and myogenic mechanisms. Both these&nbsp;mechanisms cause vasodilation of the blood vessel which leads&nbsp;to an increase&nbsp;in the&nbsp;perfusion of the tissues supplied. Metabolic mechanism is the primary theory which&nbsp;regulates the local vascular diameter of the vessel. The myogenic theory is the&nbsp;subordinate theory to the metabolic theory.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3)&nbsp;Vascular system control on the blood flow: It is also involved in the regulation of blood flow to tissues. It falls both under&nbsp;both&nbsp;the intrinsic&nbsp;and the extrinsic categories,&nbsp;so it&#39;s discussed separately here. Certain substances suchas EDRF (endothelium derived&nbsp;relaxing factor) and Endothelin are released which act&nbsp;on the endothelium itself and&nbsp;subsequently regulate the blood flow to the tissues. EDRF acts to cause vasodilation&nbsp;whereas Endothelin causes vasoconstriction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>VASCULAR SMOOTH MUSCLE CONTRACTION OR RELAXATION AND THE RESULTANT CHANGE IN BLOOD FLOW</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blood supply to a tissue brings oxygen and nutrients and removes the carbon dioxide and other waste products away as part of the perfusion. The blood vessel is surrounded by smooth muscle within its&nbsp;wall. Relaxation of vascular smooth muscle causes vasodilation, allowing more blood flow through the blood&nbsp;vessel. On the other hand, the contraction ofvascular smooth muscle&nbsp;results in&nbsp;vasoconstriction of the blood vessel which&nbsp;decreases the diameter of the vessel and reduces forward flow.&nbsp;The cascade of events which occur during the vascular smooth muscle contraction are explained below:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;On the&nbsp;smooth muscle surface membrane&nbsp;there are T-tubules along which the action potential travels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;Sarcoplasmic reticulum is the site for intracellular calcium, which is released when&nbsp;depolarization of the smooth muscle cell occurs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3)&nbsp;Calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This increases the intracellular&nbsp;Calcium levels. In a smooth muscle the interaction of actin and myosin is controlled&nbsp;by&nbsp;a&nbsp;protein called&nbsp;calmodulin&nbsp;(Tropnin-C molecule is not present is smooth muscle).&nbsp;Calcium-calmodulin complex forms when a single molecule of calmodulin binds to 4 calcium ions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4)&nbsp;Myosin molecule has a myosin head and a myosin light chain. Myosin light chain has an&nbsp;enzyme called&nbsp;myosin light chain kinase (MLCK).&nbsp;The calcium-calmodulin complex activates the enzyme myosin light chain kinase (MLCK).&nbsp;Calcium-Calmodulin complex is responsible for regulating the cross-bridge cycling in a smooth muscle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5)&nbsp;MLCK is activated by&nbsp;increased&nbsp;intracellular&nbsp;calciumlevels. Upon activation MLCK phosphorylates the myosin light chain utilizing&nbsp;an ATP molecule. When a phosphate binds to myosin light chain, it activates the myosin head which&nbsp;brings about a conformational change of the myosin head. The myosin head&nbsp;now binds to the exposed myosin binding site on the actin&nbsp;molecule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6)&nbsp;The myosin binding sites on Actin are covered by troponin and tropomyosin.&nbsp;After binding to its binding site on actin, the myosin head initiates a power stroke which results in movement of the actin filament. In a smooth muscle this cross-bridging&nbsp;of actin and myosin plus&nbsp;subsequent power stroke together result in an increased&nbsp;tension in the smooth muscle.&nbsp;Increased tension of the vascular smooth muscle results in vasoconstriction of the blood vessel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7)&nbsp;There&#39;s another enzyme called&nbsp;myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP), which has function&nbsp;opposite to that of MLCK. Post the power stroke, MLCP functions to remove the ADP from&nbsp;the myosin molecule. Once the ADP&nbsp;molecule is detached&nbsp;from the myosin head, the myosin head&nbsp;returns to its normal&nbsp;relaxed state.&nbsp;This decreases the tension inside the vascular smooth muscle and there&rsquo;s vasodilation of the blood vessel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOTE: Activation of MLCK results in the contraction of vascular smooth muscle, and the&nbsp;resultant diameter of the vessel is reduced. In contrast, MLCP activation results in&nbsp;relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle and this subsequently results in vasodilation&nbsp;of the blood vessel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[The steps involved in the vascular smooth muscle contraction aren&rsquo;t correctly explained in the lecture. &nbsp;The steps explained in the lecture are the ones involved in the skeletal muscle contraction. However, a blood vessel has a smooth muscle component&nbsp;so the steps involved should be those of a smooth muscle excitation-contraction coupling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the lecture it&rsquo;s mentioned that&nbsp;Troponin-C is and tropomyosin molecules are covering the binding site of the myosin heads on the actin molecule. However,&nbsp;Troponin C is absent in smooth muscle. Instead, calmodulin molecule is present in the vascular smooth muscle. With smooth muscle depolarization there&rsquo;s an influx of calcium ions. The calmodulin molecule (like Troponin molecule in skeletal muscle) binds to four calcium ions. This calcium-calmodulin complex is what&rsquo;s responsible for activating the MLCK enzyme. The subsequent cross-bridging sequence is similar in both smooth and skeletal muscle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also the enzymes&nbsp;MLCK &amp; MLCP are only present in the smooth muscle and not in the skeletal muscle.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>METABOLIC THEORY OF AUTOREGULATION</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The metabolic theory proposes that the oxygen delivery to a metabolically active tissue&nbsp;is determined by two factors:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Presence or absence of oxygen in the tissue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Presence or absence of metabolites in the tissue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oxygen &amp; Metabolic theory:&nbsp;Putting oxygen into the metabolic theory equation suggests that oxygen&nbsp;delivery can be&nbsp;matched to the oxygen consumption of that tissue by varying the diameter of the&nbsp;arterioles, which in turn alters the blood flow. As a tissue performs active&nbsp;metabolism, it utilizes the oxygen delivered to it via the arterioles. As a result the&nbsp;oxygen levels of the local arteriolar blood tend to drop. This means that less oxygen is available for the arteriolar endothelium and smooth muscle. Within the arteriolar smooth muscle, less oxygen is available for the phosphorylating activity of the MLCK. As a result the actin-myosin cross bridging is disrupted and the arteriolar smooth muscle tends to relax. End result of this cascade is that the arterioles undergo vasodilation and there&nbsp;is a relatively reduced resistance to the flow. Consequently tissue perfusion increases secondary to arteriolar vasodilation and increased flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Metabolic Vasodilators &amp;&nbsp;Metabolic theory:&nbsp;Actively metabolizing tissues produce certain vasodilatory metabolites which can regulate the blood flow to the tissue itself. The concentration of these metabolites is directly proportional to the level of metabolic activity performed&nbsp;by that particular tissue. Increased concentration of&nbsp;metabolites results&nbsp;in vasodilatation of the arterioles, which results in decreased resistance to the blood flow. This increased blood flow is in coherence with the increased oxygen demands of the tissue.&nbsp;In contrast, the arterioles constrict if the concentration of these metabolites decrease.&nbsp;Several key vasodilator metabolites are mentioned below:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Adenosine: &uarr;Adenosine &rarr;&nbsp;+ G-stimulatory protein &rarr;increased&nbsp;cAMP (cyclic AMP) &rarr; -&nbsp;inhibition of&nbsp;MLCK.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the kinase function of the MLCK is inhibited, the vascular smooth muscle relaxes and vasodilation follows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Carbon Dioxide</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;H+ ions</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;K+ ions</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Lactate</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Prostaglandins: Also uses&nbsp;the G-stimulatory coupled cAMP pathway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Prostacyclins</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These vasodilator metabolites can be produced both due to oxygen demand or oxygen supply mismatch situations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Oxygen demand mismatch:&nbsp;Active metabolism&nbsp;by the tissue cells utilizes the oxygen available to them.&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a resultant increase in oxygen demand by the tissues, while the supply remains unchanged. This is what happens in a rapidly exercising muscle cell. In order to match the oxygen demand, the flow to the muscle needs to be increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Oxygen supply mismatch:&nbsp;Alternatively there can be an oxygen supply mismatch. In this case the tissue need remains unchanged but the perfusion to the tissue decreases due to some reason. Following are the situations which can lead to a supply mismatch situation:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>▪&nbsp;High Altitude (decreased atmospheric pressure)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>▪&nbsp;Carbon Monoxide poisoning (CO has greater affinity for Hemoglobin than Oxygen)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>▪&nbsp;Cyanide poisoning&nbsp;(Cyanide inhibits cytochrome c oxidase and renders the electron transport chain non-functional)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>▪&nbsp;Mechanical block to blood vessels perfusing the tissue</p>\r\n\r\n<p>▪&nbsp;Pneumonia (can cause ventilation perfusion mismatch in the lungs, which decreases the flow available to tissues)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In another scenario&nbsp;let&rsquo;s&nbsp;assume that there is a spontaneous increase the perfusion&nbsp;to a tissue. This increase in perfusion can be secondary to an increase in blood volume (transfusion) or stroke volume&nbsp;(inotropic drugs). In the beginning, there will be an&nbsp;increase&nbsp;in blood flow that will deliver more oxygen&nbsp;for metabolic activity and&nbsp;simultaneously&nbsp;&ldquo;wash out&rdquo;&nbsp;the&nbsp;vasodilator metabolites.&nbsp;Consequently,&nbsp;there will be a local&nbsp;dilution of vasodilator metabolites around the tissue. Decreased&nbsp;vasodilator metabolites result&nbsp;in arteriolar&nbsp;vasoconstriction&nbsp;and a compensatory decrease in blood flow back to the normal level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Role of calcium: when the nerve impulse stimulates NMJ the calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum causes activation of MLCK and causes vasoconstriction by its action on Gq receptor, alpha 1 receptor and increases the concentration of ITP&nbsp;i.e.&nbsp;inosine&nbsp;triphosphate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Metabolic theory also explains the phenomena of active hyperaemia and reactive hyperaemia:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Active Hyperaemia&nbsp;explains that blood flow to a metabolically active tissue is directly proportional to its metabolic needs. For example, as a result of strenuous exercise the metabolic demands of the skeletal muscle are greatly increased. As compensation, the blood flow (perfusion) to the skeletal muscles is readily increased in order to meet the metabolic demands of the tissue.&nbsp;Active hyperaemia can be explained by both the metabolic and the myogenic theories of autoregulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Reactive Hyperaemia&nbsp;refers to an increase in blood flow to a tissue which received a decreased perfusion due to some reason. The reason for decreased perfusion can be arteriolar occlusion of the arterioles supplying the tissue.&nbsp;Over time, due to decreased blood flow the tissue switches to anaerobic means of respiration which creates an oxygen debt situation within the tissue. &nbsp;Also due to occluded blood supply, there&rsquo;s a build up vasodilator metabolites within the tissue&nbsp;which aren&rsquo;t washed up due to decreased perfusion. &nbsp;These vasodilator metabolites with time increase in concentration and result in vasodilatation of the arterioles which perfuse the tissue. As the blood supply resolves, the tissue&nbsp;receives a greater than normal perfusion&nbsp;until the oxygen debt situation&nbsp;is resolved.&nbsp;Reactive hyperaemia is governed by the law of compensation of blood flow. &nbsp;Reactive hyperaemia can only be explained by the metabolic theory of autoregulation; the myogenic theory cannot be used to explain it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MYOGENIC THEORY OF AUTOREGULATION</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myogenic theory of autoregulation suggests that the vascular smooth muscle itself is also responsible for its own control of contraction and relaxation. An inherent property of the smooth muscle is that that it contracts in response to stretch. Thus, if arterial pressure is suddenly increased, the arterioles are stretched and the vascular smooth muscle in their walls contracts in response to this stretch. The decreased arteriolar resistance ensures that the flow doesn&#39;t increase&nbsp;significantly.&nbsp;If there&#39;s a sudden drop in flow, there&#39;s a reduced stress placed on the arterial walls and therefore the vascular smooth muscle relaxes. The compensatory vasodilation ensures that blood flow to the tissue doesn&#39;t drop significantly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are sodium channels within the vascular smooth muscle cells. These sodium channels are normally closed and are connected to the cytoskeleton of the smooth muscle&nbsp;cell. As the blood flow within the vessel increases,&nbsp;it stretches the blood vessel plus the smooth muscle&nbsp;surrounding&nbsp;the&nbsp;bloodvessel. This stretch will also cause the microtubules&nbsp;within the cytoskeleton to stretch. The stretch on microtubules will create a mechanical pull upon the closed sodium channels and cause&nbsp;them to open. Sodium channels&nbsp;will cause an influx of sodium ions into the smooth muscle cells and bring about depolarization. Result of this cascade is that the vascular smooth muscle contracts and&nbsp;decreases the lumen of the vessel. Decreased lumen will&nbsp;decrease the flow back to the&nbsp;normal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The concept of reactive hyperaemia is explained above. It&#39;s important to remember that reactive hyperaemia cannot be explained in terms of myogenic theory.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE ROLE OF EDRF, NITRIC OXIDE &amp; ENDOTHELIN IN REGULATING LOCAL BLOOD FLOW</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EDRF and Endothelin are chemical substances released by the endothelium which&nbsp;act on the vascular smooth muscle to alter the diameter of vessel. Nitric oxide is one of the most important very important EDRF. Blood travelling at high velocity causes a shearing effect on the wall of the blood vessels as the endothelial cells endure a drag force produced due to friction. This results in a mechanical trigger which stimulates release of nitric oxide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nitric oxide, after its release from the endothelium, diffuses into&nbsp;the vascular smooth muscle. Inside the vascular smooth muscle, the NO triggers the&nbsp;guanylate cyclase&nbsp;to convert cGTP to cGMP. The increased levels of cGMP cause activation of the enzyme Myosin Light Chain Phosphatase (MLCP). The activated MLCP enzyme in turn dephosphorylates myosin light chains, which results in relaxation of the contractile apparatus of the blood vessel. As a result, the vessels become dilated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Angiotensin II receptors are present on both the vessel endothelium and also the smooth muscle surrounding the blood vessel. When Angiotensin II acts directly on the its endothelial receptor, it results in release of NO. This NO causes vasodilation by the mechanism explained above. If the Angiotensin II acts directly on its receptor on the vascular smooth muscle, then it&#39;ll cause vasoconstriction of the blood vessel. Angiotensin II receptor on the vascular smooth muscle is Gq coupled, and when bound to this receptor, Angiotensin II can act as a powerful vasoconstrictor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sildenafil&nbsp;is a drug that is used to treat erectile dysfunction. It is a Phosphodiesterase (PDE-5) inhibitor. &nbsp;Normally, PDE-5 is an enzyme that binds to and cleaves cGMP. As a result, the&nbsp;half-life&nbsp;of cGMP is reduced as its levels fall.&nbsp;Sildenafil&nbsp;acts by binding to PDE-5 and&nbsp;antagonizes&nbsp;its function (decreasing cGMP levels). With PDE-5 inhibited, the cGMP levels remain high for a longer period of time. The effect of parasympathetic NS and acetylcholine results in release of NO. This Nitric Oxide diffuses inside the&nbsp;vascular&nbsp;smooth muscle of the arteries which are responsible for penile erectile tissue perfusion. Within the vascular smooth muscle, the NO results in formation of large quantities of cGMP. Inhibited PDE-5 can no longer cleave the cGMP which stays for a longer time. cGMP activates enzyme MLCP which promotes relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle. Therefore, the penile vasculature remains dilated and engorged with blood and the erection is maintained for a longer period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Endothelin is released from damaged endothelium. After its release, Endothelin binds to its receptor on the vascular smooth muscle. Endothelin receptor is a Gq coupled receptor, which upon activation inhibits the MLCP enzyme. The inhibition of MLCP enzyme promotes contraction of the vascular smooth muscle and the vessel undergoes vasoconstriction. Hence the vascular diameter is decrease to reduce the blood flow through the damaged vessel. This is important in order to prevent blood loss at the site of damaged endothelium.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important function of EDRF is that these not only increase the local blood flow. EDRF also causes vasodilation of upstream blood vessels for the tissues that need greater perfusion. This makes sure that overall blood flow is directed to those tissues which are in need of greater perfusion due to their metabolic demands.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "locales" : [ { "languageCode" : "en-us", "source" : "23video", "referenceId" : "13433997", "referenceToken" : "10de6440a54d68f828f87d326c6dae63", "referenceLocationId" : "12732912", "authToken" : "333e87645ed1c0eedb51fae52c597694" } ], "tags" : { "section" : "Physiology", "topic" : [ "physiology", "", "Physiology", "CVS Physiology", "Cardiovascular System Clinical Foundations" ], "info" : [ "foundational", "usmleStep1", "special", "cme" ], "subject" : "Physiology", "system" : "Cardiovascular System", "concentrations" : [  ], "keywords" : [  ], "practice" : [  ] }, "packages" : [ "prohealth", "drbeen-yearly-discount", "drbeen-yearly", "yearly", "unlimited-cme", "unlimited-cme-intro", "unlimited-cme-uaprn", "uaprn-conference", "student-monthly", "student-yearly", "student-coffee-2016", "student-beans-2016", "stgeorge-sprout-2016", "np-sprout-2016", "professional-monthly", "professional-yearly", "drbeen-monthly", "monthly", "limited-student-lifetime", "lifetime-plan", "lifetime-access-special", "lifetime-access-half-price", "lifetime-access-discount", "lifetime-access-promo", "lifetime-access", "lifetime-access-49", "drnajeeb-special", "drnajeeb-cme", "stgeorge-coffee-2016", "np-coffee-2016", "stgeorge-bean-2016", "np-beans-2016", "al-ahli-hospital-pilot", "aanp-special-drnajeeb", "aanp-2017-yearly-access", "aanp-2017-lifetime-access", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-electives", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "usmle-step-1", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-79", "drbeen-yearly-49", "lifetime-access-1", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-67", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "lifetime-access-27", "drbeen-quarterly", "lifetime-discounted-50", "db-a-lifetime", "drbeen-uaprn", "db-uaprn-2018", "sellular-access", "special-been", "nc-been", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-49", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "free-trial-h", "student-monthly-22", "student-lifetime-access", "promotional-been", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-25", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "monthly", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "drbeen-gift", "lifetime-access-67", "cvs-family-practice-package", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "yearly-special", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "summer-discount", "summer-discount" ], "status" : "enabled", "slug" : "blood-flow-autoregulation", "seq" : 12, "updatedAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-12T17:00:01.227+0000" }, "instructors" : [ { "orderNum" : 1, "user" : { "$oid" : "57c6515c1a4f528e46bc4708" }, "role" : "lead" } ], "shortId" : "H19iMRuhg-", "access" : "subscription", "datePublished" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "createdAt" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "keywords" : [  ], "learningObjectives" : [  ], "ratings" : [  ], "__v" : 1 },

Theincreased levels of cGMP cause&nbsp;activation of cGMP dependent kinases which activate&nbsp;the enzyme&nbsp;Myosin Light Chain Phosphatase (MLCP). The activated MLCP enzyme&nbsp;in turn dephosphorylates&nbsp;myosin light chains which results in relaxation of the contractile apparatus. As a result, the vessels become dilated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Atherosclerosis is the formation of fibromuscular plaques on the endothelium lining of the blood vessel. These atherosclerotic plaques render the endothelium non functional. The endothelium is therefore unable to produce sufficient amounts of nitric oxide. Consequently, the levels of cGMP reduce as less cGTP is converted to cGMP. This reduction in cGMP levels in turn leads to increased levels of Myosin Light Chain Kinases (MLCK) which are enzymes with activity opposite to that of MLCP. The contractile apparatus is activated as MLCK causes&nbsp;cross bridging of actins and myosin heads. The tension produced within the vascular smooth muscle as a result of the vascular smooth muscle contraction in turn causes vasoconstriction of the blood vessel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Angiotensin II receptors are present on both the vessel endothelium and also the smooth muscle surrounding the blood vessel.&nbsp;Depending on the receptor activated, Angiotensin II can have vasodilating or vasoconstricting effects. At times these opposing effects are balanced out and one effect compensates for the other. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;The&nbsp;vasoconstricting activity of Angiotensin II&nbsp;is mediated via two pathways. If Angiotensin II binds to the Gq-coupled&nbsp;receptors on the vascular smooth muscle, it will&nbsp;cause direct deactivation of MLCP&nbsp;enzyme. It also causes the production of&nbsp;IP3 which enables the release of calcium ions from&nbsp;the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The calcium ions activate MLCK. The activation of MLCK and inactivation of MLCP results in contraction of the smooth muscles&nbsp;surrounding&nbsp;the blood vessel. This is the vasoconstricting&nbsp;effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;The&nbsp;vasodilating effect of Angiotensin II&nbsp;occurs simultaneously to mitigate the vasoconstricting effects to some extent.&nbsp;This effect is mediated by binding of the Angiotensin II to its receptor on the vascular endothelium.&nbsp;This activation of endothelial Angiotensin II receptor cause&nbsp;active release&nbsp;of nitric oxide&nbsp;from the endothelium. This NO diffuses into the vascular smooth muscle and&nbsp;stimulates the activity of guanylate cyclase&nbsp;enzyme which converts cGTP to cGMP.

PDE-5 is an enzyme that binds to and cleaves cGMP. As a result, the half life of cGMP is reduced as its levels fall. Sildenafil acts by binding to PDE-5 and antagonizes its function.&nbsp;As a result, the cGMP levels remain high for a longer period of time.

Therefore, the purpose of this lecture is to establish a better understanding of&nbsp;the&nbsp;regulation&nbsp;of blood flow&nbsp;to a muscle, both&nbsp;during rest and&nbsp;exercise. Both of these regulations&nbsp;will be&nbsp;discussed separately:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BLOOD FLOW TO A RESTING MUSCLE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blood flow to a muscle at rest is controlled globally along with the rest of the body through&nbsp;extrinsic regulation. Blood flow is extrinsically regulated through the following auto-regulatory mechanisms:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Sympathetic Nervous System&nbsp;[SANS]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Para sympathetic Nervous System&nbsp;[PANS]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Hormonal Control</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vascular smooth muscles possess both,&nbsp;alpha-1 (&alpha;-1) and&nbsp;beta-2&nbsp;(&beta;-2)&nbsp;receptors on their surface membrane that are innervated by the SANS. It is worth noting&nbsp;that during sympathetic outflow, the&nbsp;&beta;-2 response&nbsp;is dominant over the&nbsp;&alpha;-1&nbsp;response. This explains why sympathetic stimulation, which occurs in situations of flight and fight, causes the vessels supplying the skeletal muscles to dilate while causing the vessels supplying the visceras&nbsp;<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>i.e.&nbsp;splanchnic, renal and skin&nbsp;to constrict. This allows shunting of maximum amounts of blood towards the skeletal muscles.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &alpha;-1 receptors are&nbsp;G-q coupled&nbsp;receptors that cause contraction of the vascular smooth muscle&nbsp;upon stimulation. The &beta;-2 receptors are innervated by sympathetic supply as well,&nbsp;but their&nbsp;effect&nbsp;is&nbsp;inhibitory. This is because the&nbsp;&beta;-2 receptors&nbsp;are&nbsp;G&nbsp;stimulatory&nbsp;transmembrane proteins&nbsp;that decrease the intracellular levels of cAMP, thereby causing relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle and vasodilation follows. As mentioned above,&nbsp;the&nbsp;&beta;-2&nbsp;response is&nbsp;predominant over the &alpha;-1 response. However, the&nbsp;response can be shifted towards&nbsp;&alpha;-1 if&nbsp;sympathetic overflow occurs.&nbsp;With SANS response, there&rsquo;s an overflow of epinephrine. At low concentration, epinephrine occupies &beta;-2&nbsp;receptors and encourages vasodilation of vessels perfusing the skeletal muscle. However, at high concentration, epinephrine occupies &alpha;-1&nbsp;receptors and encourages vasoconstriction of vessels perfusing the skeletal muscle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, at rest the blood flow to skeletal muscles is predominantly regulated by SANS. &nbsp;This SANS control is predominantly mediated via the &beta;-2&nbsp;receptors. Since these receptors are Gstimulatory, the response generated encourages vasodilation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Note: In the lecture it&rsquo;s mentioned&nbsp;that &beta;-2&nbsp;receptor is G-s coupled. However this is not the case. In fact,&nbsp;&beta;-2&nbsp;receptors are G-i coupled, and there response is inhibitory. Please correct this.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BLOOD FLOW TO AN EXERCISING MUSCLE(ACTIVE&nbsp;STATE)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During&nbsp;exercise, the control of vascular smooth muscles becomes totally dependent on intrinsic regulatory factors. The extrinsic control becomes unresponsive and is overwhelmed by the intrinsic control. This is justified by the fact that during exercise, the demand for oxygen and the need to remove metabolic waste increases multiple folds. Therefore, the vascular caliber increases in order to increase blood flow and provide for the increase demand. The factors responsible for intrinsic control are actually waste metabolites that also have vasodilatory properties.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These vasodilator metabolites include the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;H+ ions&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Lactic acid</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Carbon dioxide</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Adenosine</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Potassium ions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These&nbsp;above mentioned metabolites also&nbsp;diminish norepinephrine&#39;s ability to vasoconstrict the arterioles. Moreover, the increased endothelial shear-stress of increased blood&nbsp;flow liberates nitric oxide&nbsp;from the endothelium itself. This NO diffuses into the vascular smooth muscle and activates the cGMP pathway&nbsp;via the myosin light chain phosphatase&nbsp;enzyme&nbsp;activation as&nbsp;discussed previously (CVS Physiology Lecture#11: Nitric Oxide). This&nbsp;eventually&nbsp;causesvasodilation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The skeletal muscles are also responsive to Angiotensin II. Angiotensin II predominantly causes vasoconstriction but it can also cause vasodilation&nbsp;to some extent. The vasodilatingeffect is carried out to balance out the more potent vasoconstricting effect&nbsp;of Angiotensin II. The vasodilating effect of Angiotensin II involves its binding to the ATII receptors on the endothelium which subsequently releases NO. &nbsp;This NO then diffuses into the vascular smooth muscle and causes vasodilation to occur.&nbsp;The Angiotensin II induced vasoconstriction is due to its binding to receptors on vascular smooth muscles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, during exercise the muscle activity increases.

We will discuss the unique blood flow control of the skin with temperature changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>STUDY NOTES: AUTOREGULATION &ndash; CUTANEOUS BLOOD FLOW</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cutaneous blood flow is primarily regulated by&nbsp;extrinsic factors, i.e. the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. Another extrinsic factor, exclusive to cutaneous blood flow, is the regulation of blood flow due to thermal changes.&nbsp;Therefore, skin is&nbsp;the only organ&nbsp;whose blood supply is regulated&nbsp;with alterations in&nbsp;temperature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>REGULATION OF BLOOD FLOOD FLOW VIA THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (ANS)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blood vessels of skin are innervated by both PANS and SANS. The receptors&nbsp;present are predominantly&nbsp;&alpha;-1 adrenergic receptors&nbsp;which are&nbsp;G-q coupled.&nbsp;&alpha;-1 adrenergic receptors, when stimulated, cause&nbsp;vasoconstriction&nbsp;of the blood vessels perfusing the skin. This results in reduced blood flow and hence, reduced blood volume supplied&nbsp;to the cutaneous regions. This vasoconstriction is also accompanied with pressure changes&nbsp;within the cutaneous blood flow. Vasoconstriction in arterioles&nbsp;causes a&nbsp;decrease&nbsp;in&nbsp;downstream&nbsp;pressure&nbsp;and an increase in the upstream pressurewith respect to&nbsp;the area of constriction. The significance of these changes lies in the fact that lesser amount of blood is now exposed to a large surface area through which heat exchange is carried out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>REGULATION OF BLOOD FLOW DUE TO CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The anterior neurons of hypothalamus are modified to detect changes in temperature. This enables the hypothalamus to work as a thermostat of the body. If the temperature of the body undergoes changes, as happens during fever, the hypothalamus makes some adjustments in the body in order to bring the temperature back to normal&nbsp;(homeostasis). During a fever, the default thermostat of the hypothalamus which is normally set at 37&#39;C, is disturbed and is raised to a higher value.&nbsp;Inflammatory mediators, such as&nbsp;Interleukin-1 and PGE2, play a&nbsp;major role in disturbing this set&nbsp;temperature&nbsp;point. The temperature of the body is raised in order to equalize the newly set temperature by&nbsp;the hypothalamus. The following events occur in the body in order to raise the body&#39;s temperature:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Shivering: This is caused by rapid contraction and relaxation of the muscles. A large amount of heat is generated&nbsp;during the process. This heat&nbsp;is utilized to raise the temperature of the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Cutaneous Vasoconstriction: The arterioles and the venules supplying the superficial parts of the body begin to constrict.&nbsp;This is mediated by increase in SANS outflow to the superficial vessels.&nbsp;As a result, thefractional&nbsp;volume of blood exposed for heat conduction reduces and minimal amount of heat is dissipated&nbsp;via the superficial vessels.&nbsp;This cutaneous vasoconstriction causes a decrease in cutaneous blood&nbsp;pressure, blood flow and blood volume; however, the&nbsp;velocity of the blood in these cutaneous vessels increases. All these&nbsp;changes&nbsp;ensure that less heat is dissipated to&nbsp;allow&nbsp;for&nbsp;conservation of heat within the core of the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Decreased Sweating: Decreased&nbsp;cholinergic sympathetic activity causes the sweat glands to suppress sweat production. Heat is, therefore, prevented from losing through evaporation of sweat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Hair Erection: The contraction of pilorector muscle causes the hair on skin to stand on their ends. These hair trap air which acts as an insulator (air is&nbsp;a poor conductor of heat). Hence, heat loss is minimized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The opposite of the aforementioned sequence happens when fever is broken and the pyretic (fever causing)&nbsp;agents are neutralized. The hypothalamic set point is normalized and the body&#39;s temperature is brought back to 37&#39;C through the reversal of events described earlier:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Cutaneous Vasodilation: SANS outflow to cutaneous vessels is reduced. This increases the cutaneous blood flow allowing for more heat dissipation from the superficial vessels. . This cutaneous vasodilation causes an increase in cutaneous blood pressure, blood flow and blood volume; however, the velocity of the blood in these cutaneous vessels decreases. All these changes ensure that more heat is dissipated to allow for less conservation of heat within the core of the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Increased Sweating:&nbsp;Increased cholinergic sympathetic outflow to sweat glands increases perspiration. This sweat, upon evaporation, has a cooling effect on the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Hair erection:&nbsp;The pilorector muscles relax and the cutaneous hair are relaxed. The insulating effect of trapped air is reduced. More heat is lost from the&nbsp;body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "locales" : [ { "languageCode" : "en-us", "source" : "23video", "referenceId" : "13433987", "referenceToken" : "8110ad19c6e392592fe21beefb70b5ee", "referenceLocationId" : "12732914", "authToken" : "d61b3ef5033e74d7902ab0432665ba49" } ], "tags" : { "section" : "Physiology", "topic" : [ "physiology", "", "Physiology", "CVS Physiology", "Cardiovascular System Clinical Foundations" ], "info" : [ "foundational", "usmleStep1", "special", "cme", "cme" ], "subject" : "Physiology", "system" : "Cardiovascular System", "concentrations" : [  ], "keywords" : [  ], "practice" : [  ] }, "packages" : [ "prohealth", "drbeen-yearly-discount", "drbeen-yearly", "unlimited-cme", "unlimited-cme-intro", "unlimited-cme-uaprn", "uaprn-conference", "student-monthly", "student-yearly", "student-coffee-2016", "student-beans-2016", "np-sprout-2016", "stgeorge-sprout-2016", "professional-monthly", "professional-yearly", "drbeen-monthly", "limited-student-lifetime", "lifetime-plan", "lifetime-access-special", "lifetime-access-half-price", "lifetime-access-discount", "lifetime-access-promo", "lifetime-access", "lifetime-access-49", "drnajeeb-special", "drnajeeb-cme", "stgeorge-coffee-2016", "np-coffee-2016", "stgeorge-bean-2016", "np-beans-2016", "al-ahli-hospital-pilot", "aanp-special-drnajeeb", "aanp-2017-yearly-access", "aanp-2017-lifetime-access", "monthly", "yearly", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-electives", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "usmle-step-1", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-79", "drbeen-yearly-49", "lifetime-access-1", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-67", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "lifetime-access-27", "drbeen-quarterly", "lifetime-discounted-50", "db-a-lifetime", "drbeen-uaprn", "db-uaprn-2018", "sellular-access", "special-been", "nc-been", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-49", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "free-trial-h", "student-monthly-22", "student-lifetime-access", "promotional-been", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-25", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "monthly", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "drbeen-gift", "lifetime-access-67", "cvs-family-practice-package", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "yearly-special", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "summer-discount", "summer-discount" ], "status" : "enabled", "slug" : "cutaneous-blood-flow-regulation", "seq" : 15, "updatedAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-12T17:00:01.228+0000" }, "instructors" : [ { "orderNum" : 1, "user" : { "$oid" : "57c6515c1a4f528e46bc4708" }, "role" : "lead" } ], "shortId" : "HJasG0d3eW", "access" : "subscription", "datePublished" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "createdAt" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "keywords" : [  ], "learningObjectives" : [  ], "ratings" : [  ], "__v" : 2 },

Blood flow in these vessels is autoregulated through&nbsp;intrinsic mechanisms(autoregulation). The brain does have sympathetic nerves innervating its blood vessels but these nerves do not play any role in regulating the blood flow. Intrinsic mechanisms that are involved in autoregulation of cerebral blood flow are theorized as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;Myogenic theory: This theory states that increase in blood flow in cerebral vasculature is counteracted by contraction of smooth muscles surrounding the blood vessels. This action helps to nullify the increase in blood flow and pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;Metabolic theory: According to the&nbsp;metabolic&nbsp;theory, the brain has the ability to autoregulate blood flow in response to changes in pH of the blood. The pH of blood&nbsp;circulating in&nbsp;the cerebral vasculature is different from that in the CSF. In other words, it is not necessary that the CSF will undergo changes in its pH if the blood being delivered to the brain has a different pH. This is explained by the fact that H+ ions, being positively charged, cannot travel across the blood-brain barrier. The pH of blood changes regularly with changes in the body. Hypoventilation causes respiratory acidosis which causes the pH to decrease.&nbsp;Similarly, ingesting drugs like aspirin, sulfonamides etc also cause marked changes in pH of blood. Therefore, if the H+ ions were allowed to pass uninterruptedly across the blood-brain barrier, the consequent changes in pH would have caused devastating effects on the brain tissue. On the other hand, gases such as carbon dioxide and oxygen can cross the blood-brain barrier as they don&rsquo;t carry a charge. The relation of blood flow with carbon dioxide is linear, i.e. increase in carbon dioxide concentration will directly cause increase in blood flow. The effects of oxygen on the cerebral blood flow are negligible; however, pathologically increasing oxygen concentration will show a prominent decrease in blood flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hypoventilation&nbsp;causes carbon dioxide levels to increase in the blood. After crossing the blood brain barrier, carbon dioxide enters the CSF where it reacts with water and&nbsp;carbonic acid&nbsp;<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>. The&nbsp;carbonic acid&nbsp;formed disassociates into hydrogen ion and&nbsp;bicarbonate&nbsp;ion. The H+ ions act on the ventrolateral part of medulla which is the central chemoreceptor of the body. The chemoreceptor zone detects changes in the chemical content of the body.&nbsp;The role of central chemoreceptors is different from that of the peripheral chemoreceptors in maintaining the homeostasis in the body.&nbsp;When triggered, it sends impulses to the nuclei present on the lower 1/3rd&nbsp;of Pons&nbsp;and upper parts of Medulla. These areas of brain are involved in cardiovascular and respiratory changes that are carried out through sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. As a result, the vessels in the body as well as in the brain&nbsp;vasodilate and the blood flow increases.&nbsp;Moreover, intrinsic&nbsp;metaboliteswhich are released by the cerebral&nbsp;tissues&nbsp;cross the blood-brain barrier and act on the vascular smooth muscles.&nbsp;This causes further vasodilation of the cerebral vessels.&nbsp;These vasodilator metabolites include the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;K+&nbsp;ions</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;H+&nbsp;ions</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Bradykinin</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Nitric Oxide</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;Monro-Kellie&nbsp;Doctrine:&nbsp;The principle says that the combined volume of&nbsp;Brain,&nbsp;blood and CSF in the cranial vault is maintained at a constant value in all circumstances. If a change in volume occurs in either of the constituents, the volume of the other fluid is shifted out or into the cranium in order to compensate for the change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "locales" : [ { "languageCode" : "en-us", "source" : "23video", "referenceId" : "13433993", "referenceToken" : "745e05874066d0350df59997fb666ec4", "referenceLocationId" : "12732912", "authToken" : "9f2b84f98db3dc59cd0fc9746f15ef42" } ], "tags" : { "section" : "Physiology", "topic" : [ "physiology", "", "Physiology", "CVS Physiology", "Cardiovascular System Clinical Foundations" ], "info" : [ "foundational", "usmleStep1", "special", "cme", "cme" ], "subject" : "Physiology", "system" : "Cardiovascular System", "concentrations" : [  ], "keywords" : [  ], "practice" : [  ] }, "packages" : [ "prohealth", "drbeen-yearly-discount", "drbeen-yearly", "unlimited-cme", "unlimited-cme-intro", "unlimited-cme-uaprn", "uaprn-conference", "student-monthly", "student-yearly", "student-coffee-2016", "student-beans-2016", "np-sprout-2016", "stgeorge-sprout-2016", "professional-monthly", "professional-yearly", "drbeen-monthly", "limited-student-lifetime", "lifetime-plan", "lifetime-access-special", "lifetime-access-half-price", "lifetime-access-discount", "lifetime-access-promo", "lifetime-access", "lifetime-access-49", "drnajeeb-special", "drnajeeb-cme", "stgeorge-coffee-2016", "np-coffee-2016", "stgeorge-bean-2016", "np-beans-2016", "al-ahli-hospital-pilot", "aanp-special-drnajeeb", "aanp-2017-yearly-access", "aanp-2017-lifetime-access", "monthly", "yearly", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-electives", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "usmle-step-1", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-79", "drbeen-yearly-49", "lifetime-access-1", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-67", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "lifetime-access-27", "drbeen-quarterly", "lifetime-discounted-50", "db-a-lifetime", "drbeen-uaprn", "db-uaprn-2018", "sellular-access", "special-been", "nc-been", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-49", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "free-trial-h", "student-monthly-22", "student-lifetime-access", "promotional-been", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-25", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "monthly", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "drbeen-gift", "lifetime-access-67", "cvs-family-practice-package", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "yearly-special", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "summer-discount", "summer-discount" ], "status" : "enabled", "slug" : "cerebral-blood-flow-regulation", "seq" : 16, "updatedAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-12T17:00:01.228+0000" }, "instructors" : [ { "orderNum" : 1, "user" : { "$oid" : "57c6515c1a4f528e46bc4708" }, "role" : "lead" } ], "shortId" : "SJAjMROheW", "access" : "subscription", "datePublished" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "createdAt" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "keywords" : [  ], "learningObjectives" : [  ], "ratings" : [  ], "__v" : 2 },

We will discuss the impact of the coronary arteries supplying from the surface instead of being embedded in the tissue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>STUDY NOTES:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUTOREGULATION &ndash; CORONARY BLOOD FLOW</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The coronary vasculature supplies blood to the muscles of the heart&nbsp;(myocardium). These coronary arteries&nbsp;are the first branches (right &amp; left coronary arteries) that&nbsp;arise from the aorta,&nbsp;and&nbsp;they&nbsp;run on the surface of the heart&#39;s muscle. Branches from the arteries penetrate the muscle in order to supply blood to deeper&nbsp;myocardial&nbsp;tissues. When the heart contracts during systole, the small arteries that are embedded deeply&nbsp;within the heart musculature are&nbsp;also&nbsp;squeezed along with the heart.&nbsp;This mechanical compression of coronary arteries causes a brief period of occlusion of coronary blood flow during systole.&nbsp;Therefore, it should be established that the whole body&nbsp;receives&nbsp;oxygenated&nbsp;blood during systole except for the heart&nbsp;itself. The heart will be supplied with&nbsp;the oxygenated&nbsp;blood when the atria and ventricles are in a relaxed state which&nbsp;happens during diastole. At that time, the coronary vasculature is not compressed and the perfusion is at a maximum. The right heart muscles contract with lesser force compared to the left heart. Hence, a relatively small amount of perfusion is maintained in the right heart even during systole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even under normal resting conditions, the heart tissue extracts 80% of the total oxygen content from the blood that is supplied to it. This high extraction&nbsp;of&nbsp;oxygen is necessary to meet the demands of highly active muscles of the heart. The demand for oxygen is increased substantially when there is an increase in the heart rate, as happens during exercise. Compared&nbsp;to the cardiac muscle, the skeletal muscle extracts only 20% of oxygen from the blood&nbsp;at normal resting conditions.&nbsp;In other tissues, when oxygen demand increases, vasodilatory metabolites such as H+ ions and carbon dioxide cause a rightward shift of the oxygen dissociation curve. This allows greater&nbsp;dissociation&nbsp;of oxygen&nbsp;from the hemoglobin.However, this rightward shift of the hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve is not valid for the blood in the coronary circulation. This is because&nbsp;the extraction of oxygen&nbsp;by heart tissue&nbsp;is already at maximum level even&nbsp;under normal resting conditions.&nbsp;Therefore, the increased demand for oxygen during&nbsp;exercise&nbsp;can&nbsp;only be compensated&nbsp;by increasing the blood flow rate of the coronary circulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The flow of coronary vasculature is under the influence of both&nbsp;intrinsic&nbsp;and extrinsic mechanisms. The&nbsp;extrinsic mechanisms&nbsp;include the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;The&nbsp;PANS&nbsp;input is relayed by the right and left vagus nerves. Right&nbsp;vagus&nbsp;nerve innervates the&nbsp;Sinoatrial node&nbsp;i.e&nbsp;SA&nbsp;Node, while the left vagus nerve innervates the AV&nbsp;Node.&nbsp;The PANS&nbsp;regulates&nbsp;the blood flow indirectly by controlling the heart rate&nbsp;(chronotropy) and the force of contraction (inotropy).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;The&nbsp;SANS&nbsp;innervates the SA&nbsp;Node&nbsp;&amp;AV&nbsp;Node, the myocardium and also&nbsp;the vascular smooth muscle of coronary vessels.&nbsp;SANS receptors are alpha-1,&nbsp;beta-2 predominantly the alpha-1 type.&nbsp;Hence, SANS regulates the heart rate, force of contraction of ventricular myocardium and the flow into the coronary vasculature.&nbsp;However, the extrinsic mechanisms involved in vascular diameter changes are ineffective during&nbsp;physiologicalconditions. Although there is sympathetic stimulation on the vascular smooth muscles, the effects are negated by the constant release of nitric oxide from&nbsp;the endothelium.&nbsp;If this nitric oxide release is&nbsp;blocked&nbsp;by an&nbsp;atherosclerotic&nbsp;plaque, the unchecked&nbsp;sympathetic stimulation causes&nbsp;vasoconstriction leading to the pain of angina.&nbsp;Atherosclerosis decreases coronary perfusion by reducing the coronary artery lumen and also by blocking the release of NO from the coronary artery endothelium. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under physiological conditions, the metabolism&nbsp;induced changes in vascular&nbsp;caliber&nbsp;are more prominent. The metabolites produced by the heart tissue responsible for vasodilation are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;H+ ions</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;K+ ions</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Adenosine</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Bradykinin and Prostaglandins</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Volume - Work Relationship</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a direct relationship between the volume of blood entering the heart (preload) and the work done by&nbsp;the&nbsp;heart to pump it&nbsp;out. The pressure remains the same as there is no change in&nbsp;myocardial&nbsp;contractility or afterload. This can be observed when a person is exercising during which the volume of blood returning to the heart increases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pressure - Work Relationship</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a direct relationship between the pressure developed in the peripheral vasculature and the work done by the heart against it. The demand for oxygen in pressure overload situations is higher than in volume overload. Patients with atherosclerosis show this kind of pressure - work relationship in their cardiovascular system.</p>\r\n", "locales" : [ { "languageCode" : "en-us", "source" : "23video", "referenceId" : "13433992", "referenceToken" : "94228953f8ebcc0908d6d9dd9024df26", "referenceLocationId" : "12732918", "authToken" : "793fd3b0291410aade89a565bdac0630" } ], "tags" : { "section" : "Physiology", "topic" : [ "physiology", "", "Physiology", "CVS Physiology", "Cardiovascular System Clinical Foundations" ], "info" : [ "foundational", "usmleStep1", "special", "cme" ], "subject" : "Physiology", "system" : "Cardiovascular System", "concentrations" : [  ], "keywords" : [  ], "practice" : [  ] }, "packages" : [ "prohealth", "drbeen-yearly-discount", "drbeen-yearly", "unlimited-cme", "unlimited-cme-intro", "unlimited-cme-uaprn", "uaprn-conference", "student-monthly", "student-yearly", "student-coffee-2016", "student-beans-2016", "np-sprout-2016", "stgeorge-sprout-2016", "professional-monthly", "professional-yearly", "drbeen-monthly", "limited-student-lifetime", "lifetime-plan", "lifetime-access-special", "lifetime-access-half-price", "lifetime-access-discount", "lifetime-access-promo", "lifetime-access", "lifetime-access-49", "drnajeeb-special", "drnajeeb-cme", "stgeorge-coffee-2016", "np-coffee-2016", "stgeorge-bean-2016", "np-beans-2016", "al-ahli-hospital-pilot", "aanp-special-drnajeeb", "aanp-2017-yearly-access", "aanp-2017-lifetime-access", "monthly", "yearly", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-electives", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "usmle-step-1", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-79", "drbeen-yearly-49", "lifetime-access-1", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-67", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "lifetime-access-27", "drbeen-quarterly", "lifetime-discounted-50", "db-a-lifetime", "drbeen-uaprn", "db-uaprn-2018", "sellular-access", "special-been", "nc-been", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-49", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "free-trial-h", "student-monthly-22", "student-lifetime-access", "promotional-been", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-25", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "monthly", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "drbeen-gift", "lifetime-access-67", "cvs-family-practice-package", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "yearly-special", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "summer-discount", "summer-discount" ], "status" : "enabled", "slug" : "coronary-blood-flow-regulation", "seq" : 17, "updatedAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-12T17:00:01.229+0000" }, "instructors" : [ { "orderNum" : 1, "user" : { "$oid" : "57c6515c1a4f528e46bc4708" }, "role" : "lead" } ], "shortId" : "H1keiMRO2lb", "access" : "subscription", "datePublished" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "createdAt" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "keywords" : [  ], "learningObjectives" : [  ], "ratings" : [  ], "__v" : 1 },

The regulation of blood pressure is done in order to maintain the&nbsp;MAP. The&nbsp;MAP hence&nbsp;dictates the amount of oxygen and nutrients that is supplied by the blood vessels and the waste that is carried away from the tissues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The body has the ability to counteract long term as well as short term changes in blood pressure. The long term pressure changes cause the body to respond through the activation of renin-angiotensin system.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rapid/short term changes in blood pressure compel the body to activate the following receptors:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Baroreceptor present on the arch of aorta&nbsp;and carotid sinus</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Chemoreceptors present&nbsp;all over the body, aorta and&nbsp;carotid sinuses</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Atrial receptors present on the wall of right atrium</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These receptors are modified nerve endings that are sensitive to rapid offsets in blood pressure. Rapid offsets in pressure can occur, for example, in a previously standing person who suddenly sits down. During the process, a large volume of blood is shifted from the peripheral to the central regions of the body. Consequently, a large volume of blood enters the heart and this volume overload&nbsp;(increased preload)&nbsp;causes the heart to increase its cardiac output. A simultaneous increase in blood pressure will also be observed with increase in cardiac output. The increase in blood pressure is registered by the baroreceptors which are densely situated on the walls of the arch of aorta and the carotid&nbsp;sinus which is present on internal carotid artery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, a drop in blood pressure is registered by the baroreceptors when&nbsp;the person stands up suddenly from a sitting position. These pressure sensing bodies are modified nerves with stretch receptors on their ends. These stretch receptors are attached to the&nbsp;cytoskeleton&nbsp;present within the nerve endings.&nbsp;These nerve endings are called spray type nerves.&nbsp;High blood pressure in the blood vessels causes stretch of these receptors which results in movement of sodium ions into the nerve endings, thereby, initiating an action potential.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These&nbsp;baroreceptors have a baseline firing pattern. That means they have an intrinsic potential to generate action potentials at a particular frequency at all times. This frequency is increased when the baroreceptors&nbsp;receive&nbsp;a stretch stimulus secondary to increase in blood pressure. The carotid sinuses increase their rate of impulse generation when the pressure in them&nbsp;builds&nbsp;up&nbsp;to values greater than 50&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg. Below thisthreshold pressure,&nbsp;the carotid baroreceptors fail to initiate an action potential. On the other hand, the arch of aorta can record drops in blood pressure up&nbsp;to 30&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg. The upper limit for blood pressure, after which the frequency of action potential stops increasing, is 175&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg. The normal MAP is calculated to be&nbsp;93&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg. At this pressure, the&nbsp;baroreceptors are&nbsp;believed&nbsp;to be the most sensitive and even slight changes in pressure will result in rapid firing of action potentials. At blood pressures lower than&nbsp;30&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg, the chemoreceptors come into play. The chemoreceptors function&nbsp;by sensing the&nbsp;arterial&nbsp;concentration of carbon dioxide, oxygen, Ph&nbsp;and other metabolites rather than detecting changes in blood pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>STRUCTURE OF THE CAROTID SINUS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The carotid sinus is present on the base of internal carotid artery at the level of bifurcation of the common carotid artery. The sinus area is slightly dilated as the tunica media which is normally comprised of muscles, is relatively thin. The tunica adventitia, on the other hand, is thicker than usual. This is the layer of the blood vessels where the nerve receptors are situated. Same is true for the location of baroreceptors on the arch of aorta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE BARORECEPTOR REFLEX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The baroreceptor reflex, like other reflex arcs, is comprised of three units:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;Afferent nerve carrying impulses from the receptors,&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;Central processing unit&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3)&nbsp;An efferent nerve that innervates the effector</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Afferent impulses from the carotid sinus are carried by the Herring nerve, a branch of Glossopharyngeal nerve (CN-9). In the case of&nbsp;baroreceptors&nbsp;present on the arch of aorta, the Vagus nerve (CN-10) is the afferent nerve that carries impulses to the spinal cord. Both, the Vagus nerve and the Glossopharyngeal nerve, feed impulses from the baroreceptors into the nucleus of tractus solitarius. These nuclei are situated in the medulla of the spinal cord and their job is to process the incoming&nbsp;afferent&nbsp;impulses. Also&nbsp;within the Medulla and lower 1/3rd of the&nbsp;Pons, there arevasoconstricting center, the vasodilatory center and the cardio-inhibitory&nbsp;center. These centers&nbsp;receive&nbsp;processed impulses from the nucleus of tractus solitarius and from here efferent impulses in the form of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves arise. Impulses are carried to the heart via the parasympathetic Vagus nerve. Sympathetic impulses travel down the intermedio-lateral segment of the spinal cord and give rise to efferent motor spinal nerves which enter the sympathetic ganglion running parallel to the spinal cord. Postganglionic sympathetic nerves ultimately supply the heart&nbsp;and the peripheral vasculature. Another preganglionic sympathetic nerve also supplies the adrenal medulla which results in the&nbsp;release&nbsp;of epinephrine and norepinephrine,&nbsp;which further contribute in enhancing the&nbsp;sympathetic activity. The end result is either an increase or decrease in the blood pressure, thereby correcting the disturbance in hemodynamics of the body. This phenomenon is also referredto as the buffering effect,&nbsp;since&nbsp;the change in pressure is buffered back to normal. The Vagus and Glossopharyngeal nerves, because of the same reason, are therefore known as the buffering nerves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The factors responsible for change in mean arterial pressure are formulated as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>➢&nbsp;MAP = Heart Rate x Cardiac Output&nbsp;(CO)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whereas, CO = SV&nbsp;(stroke volume)&nbsp;x&nbsp;TPR (total peripheral resistance)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, MAP = HR x SV x TPR<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stroke volume is altered by altering the force of contractility of the heart muscles. The sympathetic nerves supplying the heart muscles affect the stroke volume. The parasympathetic nerves supplying the SA and AV node are responsible for producing changes in heart rate. The TPR can be increased or decreased by changing the diameter of peripheral vasculature which is under the control of the sympathetic nervous system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EFFECTS OF BARORECEPTORS DURING VARIOUS CONDITIONS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;DUE TO CHANGES IN BLOOD PRESSURE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a.&nbsp;Reduced Blood Pressure: Reduction in blood pressure will result in a decrease in the number of afferent impulses from the baroreceptors. The sympathetic activity will increase and as a result, the TPR, HR and the&nbsp;stroke volume will allincrease.&nbsp;At the same time, the parasympathetic input&nbsp;will taper down. All these changes&nbsp;will result in increasing the blood pressure back to normal</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b.&nbsp;Increased Blood Pressure: This happens&nbsp;in situations like exercise or stress. Increased blood pressure will result in stretching of&nbsp;the stretch receptors.&nbsp;This increases the&nbsp;frequency of afferent impulses. Sympathetic supply will decrease and the parasympathetic system will take over. Finally, the blood pressure is decreased&nbsp;back to normal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;DUE TO CHANGES IN CARDIAC OUTPUT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a.&nbsp;Decreased Cardiac Output: Occurs in situations of vomiting, diarrhea,&nbsp;hemorrhage&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;As a result of these, both the volume, and therefore pressure&nbsp;of&nbsp;the blood decreases.&nbsp;Afferent impulse firing&nbsp;of the baroreceptors&nbsp;decreases.&nbsp;As a consequence, there&rsquo;s a sympathetic overflow which causes an&nbsp;increase in HR, TPR and SV.&nbsp;Due to an increase in these parameters, the blood pressure is raised back to normal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b.&nbsp;Increased&nbsp;Cardiac Output:&nbsp;There&rsquo;s an increased impulse generation from the baroreceptors due stretch caused by increased&nbsp;volume of blood.&nbsp;This increased afferent input from the baroreceptors results in activation of the PANS. Once activated, the&nbsp;parasympathetic nervous system&nbsp;decreases&nbsp;the blood pressure back&nbsp;to normal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3)&nbsp;MASSAGING THE CAROTID SINUS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Massaging the carotid sinuses physically increases the pressure on the baroreceptors present there. The carotid baroreceptors respond by increasing the rate of afferent impulse firing. The sympathetic system will be shut down and the parasympathetic system is activated.

This fibrous demarcation acts as an insulator, thereby barricading the entrance of electrical activity from the atria into the ventricles. The functional structure of the heart requires it to fill the atria with blood before the ventricles. Therefore, it is&nbsp;important for the atrial musculature&nbsp;to contract first and force blood&nbsp;into the ventricles before the&nbsp;ventricles&nbsp;undergo contraction. After a time lapse of milliseconds, electrical activity in both the ventricles causes them to contract and pump blood to the pulmonary circuit and to the rest of the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Electrical activity in the cardiac muscle is initiated&nbsp;by the sinoatrial node (SAN),&nbsp;located near to the opening of superior vena cava. The SA node is comprised of a collection of modified cardiac cells that have the potential to generate electrical signals. Multiple pathways, originating from the SAN, carry electrical signals to the atrial muscles. Similarly, one of the pathways stimulates the atrioventricular node (AVN) present at the base&nbsp;of right atrium and limited by&nbsp;the coronary sinus, the atrial septum and the tricuspid valve (Coch&rsquo;s&nbsp;triangle). Bundles of&nbsp;fibers&nbsp;arise from the AV node, pierce the atrioventricular&nbsp;fibrous ring&nbsp;and enter the ventricles. In the ventricles, the&nbsp;fibers&nbsp;recollect and divide into two bundles that run down the interventricular septum. These bundles are known as the bundle of His. Upon reaching the apex of the heart, the bundles of His give rise to Purkinje&nbsp;fibers&nbsp;that ascend along the ventricular walls in a fashion which allows for spread of electrical activity in an ascending fashion (from the apex to upwards).&nbsp;As the conduction&nbsp;fiberspass from atria to ventricles their diameter increases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TYPES OF CELLS PRESENT IN THE CARDIAC SYSTEM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cells of the cardiac system are primarily classified as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Functional Cells</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Electrical Cells</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;Functional cells&nbsp;of the heart are further divided into contractile cells and conducting cells. Contractile cells are basically muscular cells that are joined together at their ends forming intercalated discs. Gap junctions between cells within the intercalated discs allow movement of ions, thereby causing the heart to work as a syncytium&nbsp;(single unit). Hence, the contractile cells show properties of conduction as well. Conducting cells, on the other hand, are modified to allow passage of electrical current only and do not exhibit&nbsp;any contractile properties.In the embryonic stage they were contractile muscle cells which later became&nbsp;conducting cells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;Electrical cells&nbsp;are sub-classified into fast and slow fibers depending upon the conduction velocity and speed of depolarization&nbsp;which they exhibit. The rate at which an action&nbsp;potential travels through a conducting fiber depends on its diameter and the presence of various channels on its cell membrane.&nbsp;Purkinje fibers have the largest diameter relative to the rest of the fibers in the conducting system. Hence,&nbsp;Purkinje fibers have&nbsp;the highest conduction velocity.&nbsp;The diameter of His Purkinje&nbsp;fibers&nbsp;is 150 times larger than AV&nbsp;fibers&nbsp;and 6 times larger than Ventricular muscle&nbsp;fibers.&nbsp;In general, the&nbsp;conducting fibers&nbsp;in the heart&nbsp;also possess fast sodium channels on their cell membranes. The number of these&nbsp;fast sodium&nbsp;channels helps&nbsp;determine the rate of depolarization and hence, the conduction velocity.Velocity of conduction of His Purkinje&nbsp;fibers&nbsp;is 4m/sec&nbsp;while that&nbsp;of AV&nbsp;fibers&nbsp;is 2m/sec.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two nodes&nbsp;(SAN &amp; AVN), on the other hand, have slow calcium channels present on their cell membranes.&nbsp;They do not have sodium&nbsp;channels.&nbsp;Movement&nbsp;of ions through these channels results in a gradual increase in the membrane potential leading to slow depolarization of the nodes.&nbsp;They have slow depolarizing&nbsp;fibers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another determinant affecting conduction velocity is the presence of gap&nbsp;junctions&nbsp;between cardiac cells. Gap junctions facilitate movement of ions from one cell to another. Higher the number of these gap&nbsp;junctions, higher would be the conduction velocity as more cells get depolarized at a time. The AV node and&nbsp;its emergentfibers&nbsp;have the least number of gap junctions and hence, the conduction velocity is slowest.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BEATS PER MINUTE:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The size of the cardiac cycle is determined by the formula</p>\r\n\r\n<p>60 seconds</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Number of beats per minute = 60/72=0.8 seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DIRECTION OF IMPULSE TRAVEL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before moving on, it should be noted that the two nodes&nbsp;(SAN &amp; AVN)&nbsp;and all the conducting&nbsp;fibers&nbsp;in the heart muscle have an intrinsic ability to undergo depolarization. This explains why even if the heart is isolated from the rest of the body, it will resume its pacemaker activity and continue to beat on its own. An isolated SA node has the highest frequency of impulse generation, i.e. 100 beats/min. This intrinsic rhythm of the SAN&nbsp;is regulated down to 72 beats/min under the influence of the autonomic nervous system. Similarly, the AV node has the ability to depolarize at a rate of 60 beats/min. SA node, having a considerably higher frequency of depolarization, overrides the pace maker activity of the AV node. This causes the AV node to generate action potentials at a rate similar to SA node. Upon cessation of high frequency impulses from SA node, as happens during bundle blocks,&nbsp;due to ischemia or experimental destruction of SA Node&nbsp;the AV node is shown to beat at its own inherent frequency. There is a respective decrease in the frequency of depolarization as we move along the bundle of His and the Purkinje&nbsp;fibers. This relative difference&nbsp;in&nbsp;the intrinsic rhythm of different parts of the cardiac conduction system&nbsp;allows&nbsp;a&nbsp;uni-directional flow of impulses across&nbsp;the&nbsp;entire conducting system.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that, AV bundle is the only pathway which allows electrical transmission of impulses from atria to the ventricles.&nbsp;Moreover, the impulses are prevented from propagating in retrograde direction (back into the atria from the ventricles)&nbsp;by the fibrous atrioventricular&nbsp;ring or annulus&nbsp;(insulating layer). If the impulses were allowed to travel back into the atria through accessory pathways, the heart would lose its rhythmical beating and&nbsp;arrhythmias&nbsp;may ensue.</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>PART OF THE CONDUCTING SYSTEM</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>INTRINSIC RHYTHM (BPM)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>SAN&nbsp;(Pacemaker of Heart)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>100&nbsp;(Normal HR is 72 BPM under the influence of ANS)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>AVN</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>50-60</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>AV Bundle of His</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>40-50</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Purkinje fibers</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>15-30</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DURATION OF IMPULSES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duration of impulses is important as it dictates periodic filling of the atria and ventricles and ejection of blood effectively. The duration of an impulse travelling along the conducting system can be briefly described as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;It takes 0.03 seconds for an impulse to travel from SA node to the AV node.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;The speed is substantially reduced as impulses reach AV node because of its smaller diameter&nbsp;(1*3*5mm)&nbsp;and fewer gap junctions. As a consequence, a time lapse of 0.09 seconds occurs within the AV node.&nbsp;Since, impulse transmission is the slowest within the AVN; it&rsquo;s a site for various drugs that affect the heart rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Travelling&nbsp;further, it takes 0.04 seconds for the impulse to move along the AV bundle and the bundle of His.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;It takes another 0.06 seconds for the impulse to spread throughout the ventricular muscles as the fast Purkinje&nbsp;fibers&nbsp;allow rapid and instantaneous conduction of nerve impulses. This is made possible due to the large diameter of Purkinje&nbsp;fibers&nbsp;and presence of numerous gap junctions.

VENTRICULAR ACTION POTENTIAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nodal tissues and the Purkinje fibers exhibit automaticity in their properties as they are able to undergo spontaneous depolarizations. In other words, these tissues do not require the need of an external stimulus or a trigger to undergo depolarization. This is in contrast to ventricular fibers that do not show automaticity. The reason behind this phenomenon can be explained as follow:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;The resting membrane potential (RMP) of nodal tissues is less negative than the RMP of ventricular fibers. This allows the nodal tissue channels to operate in a semi-activated state even during the resting phase of the action potential. The comparatively more negative ventricular fibers do not show this property and hence, are not easily activated by low voltage impulses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Secondly, the presence of fast sodium channels and slow calcium channels, in ventricular fibers and nodal tissue respectively, play an important role in the automaticity of a cell. The slow calcium channels in the nodal tissues are responsible for the peak voltage occurring during a nodal action potential. Whereas, in the ventricular muscle fibers, the fast sodium channels are responsible for the same voltage spike and the calcium channels are involved only during the plateau phase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PHASES DURING AN ACTION POTENTIAL</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>PHASE OF ACTION POTENTIAL</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>VENTRICULAR MUSCLE FIBER</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>NODAL TISSUES</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Phase 0</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Opening of Sodium channels</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>(Depolarization)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Opening of Calcium channels</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>(Depolarization)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Phase 1</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Opening of transient Potassium &amp; Chloride channels</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Does not occur</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Phase 2</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Plateau phase: Opening of slow Calcium channels</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Does not occur</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Phase 3</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Repolarization: Opening of Potassium channels</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Repolarization: Opening of Potassium channels</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Phase 4</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Resting Membrane Potential</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Resting Membrane Potential</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\f</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SLOPE OF DEPOLARIZATION DURING NODAL ACTION POTENTIAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a gradual increase in the RMP of nodal tissues from -55mV to -40mV. This is known as the slope of depolarization, after which occurs the Phase 0 of action potential. This slope is important as multiple factors, such as the&nbsp;ANS&nbsp;and certain drugs, act to alter this phase and bring about changes in the rate and&nbsp;rhythm&nbsp;of cardiac activity. An increase in the slope of depolarization will cause the SA&nbsp;Nodeto generate action potentials at a higher rate. Flattening of the slope will result in&nbsp;fewer numbers&nbsp;of action potentials&nbsp;in a given time which greatly&nbsp;decreases the rate at which the heart beats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CONTROL OF HEART RATE &amp; CONDUCTION VELOCITY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An isolated SA node has the highest&nbsp;intrinsic rhythm&nbsp;of impulse generation, i.e.&nbsp;100 beats/min. This&nbsp;intrinsic rhythm of&nbsp;SA Node&nbsp;is regulated down to 72 beats/min under the influence of the autonomic nervous system. Similarly, the AV node has the ability to depolarize at&nbsp;a rate of&nbsp;55&nbsp;beats/min. SANode,&nbsp;having a considerably higher frequency of depolarization, overrides the pace maker activity of the AVNode. This causes the AV node to generate action potentials at a rate similar to SA node. Upon cessation of high frequency impulses from SA node, as happens during bundle blocks, the AV node is shown to beat at its own inherent frequency.&nbsp;Impulse generation of purkinje fibers is at a rate of 15-30 beats/min.&nbsp;There is a respective decrease in the frequency of depolarization as we move along the bundle of His and the Purkinje fibers.&nbsp;This relative difference&nbsp;in&nbsp;the intrinsic rhythm of different parts of the cardiac conduction system&nbsp;allows&nbsp;a uni-directional flow of impulses across&nbsp;the&nbsp;entire conducting system.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As described above, the SA node has the highest rate of depolarization and therefore, it dictates the rate of cardiac activity. Altering with the mechanics of SA node will cause alterations in the rate of heart beat as a whole. Similarly, the velocity of conduction is controlled by the AV node(dimensions are 1*3*5 mm)&nbsp;and AV bundles as the speed of impulse travelling through them is the slowest.&nbsp;Time duration for conduction through these is 0.12 seconds.&nbsp;Velocity&nbsp;of impulse at AV node and AV bundle is 2&nbsp;meters&nbsp;per second and 4&nbsp;meters&nbsp;per second in purkinje fibers.&nbsp;Dromotropes act on these areas of the conducting system and cause changes in the velocity of impulse conduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DIFFERENT ION CHANNELS AND THEIR AFFECT ON THE ACTION POTENTIAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;VENTRICULAR ACTION POTENTIAL​​</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;The&nbsp;Phase 0&nbsp;of ventricular action potential is brought about by fast voltage gated sodium channels.&nbsp;This phase is referred to as the upstroke of action potential&nbsp;and corresponds to the QRS complex of the ECG.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;At the end of depolarization, there is a brief fall in the voltage of action potential as a result of opening of transient chloride and potassium channels. This isPhase 1&nbsp;of the depolarization.&nbsp;Fast sodium channels transition to their inactivated state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;L-type Calcium&nbsp;channels open in the&nbsp;Phase 2&nbsp;of action potential.&nbsp;The inward calcium current balances the outward potassium current and there&rsquo;s little change in membrane potential, which explains the plateau. During this&nbsp;plateau phase&nbsp;no&nbsp;change in the voltage is registered.&nbsp;Phase 2 or the plateau phase of the ventricular action potential corresponds to ST segment of the ECG.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Phase 3&nbsp;corresponds to repolarization during which Potassium channels open in response to voltage and ion concentration difference.&nbsp;By this time L-type Calcium channels, which were open during the plateau phase, have also closed.&nbsp;Repolarization corresponds to the T-wave on the ECG.&nbsp;Inward Potassium current enters via the:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>▪&nbsp;IK1&nbsp;channels:&nbsp;Inward rectifying K&nbsp;channel&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>▪&nbsp;IKR&nbsp;channels:&nbsp;Slow and rapid&nbsp;delayed<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>&nbsp;rectifying K&nbsp;channel&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;The&nbsp;action potential is brought back to the resting membrane potential&nbsp;(RMP)&nbsp;or&nbsp;Phase 4. The sodium-potassium ATP-ase is responsible for the maintenance of RMP until the arrival of the next action potential.&nbsp;Fast Na+,&nbsp;L-type&nbsp;Ca2+, and rectifying K+&nbsp;channels (IKR) close, but&nbsp;IK1&nbsp;channels remain open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;NODAL ACTION POTENTIAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand that the nodal tissue (SA and AV) lacks fast Na+ channels. Thus, the upstroke of the action&nbsp;potential is mediated by inward calcium&nbsp;current rather than&nbsp;the sodium&nbsp;current. In addition, note&nbsp;that phases 1 and 2 are absent in the nodal tissue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;The&nbsp;RMP (Phase 4)&nbsp;in nodal tissue is kept at -55mV by the&nbsp;Na-K ATPase&nbsp;pump. The less negative RMP of nodal tissue, compared to -70mV of ventricular tissues, allows it to&nbsp;exhibit&nbsp;automaticity. At -55mV, the fast sodium channels (also known as &#39;funny&#39; channels) are in a semi-open state which causes leakage of positive ions into the nodal cells. Leakage of ions causes an increase in the membrane potential in a positive direction. The membrane potential gradually increases to -40mV. Upon reaching this threshold potential, the sodium channels close and remain closed for the rest of the action potential as they enter a state of refractoriness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;At this point the slow-gated&nbsp;T-type&nbsp;calcium channels open which creates the spike of depolarization&nbsp;(Phase 0).&nbsp;These differ from the L-type&nbsp;calcium channels (in the ventricular tissue)&nbsp;in that they open at a more negative&nbsp;membrane potential (-70 mV).The calcium ions that enter the cells during this phase are also involved in excitation-contraction coupling of the myosin light chains with actin filaments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Repolarization&nbsp;(Phase 3)&nbsp;in nodal tissue is similar to that of ventricular muscle fibers.&nbsp;Inward Potassium current enters via the IK1&nbsp;&amp; IKR&nbsp;(rectifying K currents) channels.&nbsp;The fall in membrane potential will result in activation of the sodium-potassium ATPase and the cycle is repeated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "locales" : [ { "languageCode" : "en-us", "source" : "23video", "referenceId" : "13433922", "referenceToken" : "5e17beed14c7c13496b757ec6a2bea6a", "referenceLocationId" : "12732918", "authToken" : "dc4a886a1ef722a46687ceb0387aed75" } ], "tags" : { "section" : "Physiology", "topic" : [ "physiology", "EKG Interpretation", "", "Essentials: EKG Analysis and Interpretation Series", "Physiology", "The Basics", "EKG Basics", "CVS Physiology", "Cardiovascular System Clinical Foundations" ], "info" : [ "foundational", "usmleStep1", "special", "cme" ], "subject" : "Physiology", "system" : "Cardiovascular System", "concentrations" : [  ], "keywords" : [  ], "practice" : [  ] }, "packages" : [ "prohealth", "drbeen-yearly-discount", "drbeen-yearly", "unlimited-cme", "unlimited-cme-intro", "unlimited-cme-uaprn", "uaprn-conference", "student-monthly", "student-yearly", "student-coffee-2016", "student-beans-2016", "np-sprout-2016", "stgeorge-sprout-2016", "professional-monthly", "professional-yearly", "drbeen-monthly", "limited-student-lifetime", "lifetime-plan", "lifetime-coffee-2016", "lifetime-access-special", "lifetime-access-half-price", "lifetime-access-discount", "lifetime-access-promo", "lifetime-access", "lifetime-access-49", "ekg-interpretation-course", "drnajeeb-special", "drnajeeb-cme", "stgeorge-coffee-2016", "np-coffee-2016", "stgeorge-bean-2016", "np-beans-2016", "al-ahli-hospital-pilot", "aanp-special-drnajeeb", "aanp-2017-yearly-access", "aanp-2017-lifetime-access", "monthly", "yearly", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-electives", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "usmle-step-1", "usmle-step-1", "usmle-step-1", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-79", "drbeen-yearly-49", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-67", "lifetime-access-67", "lifetime-access-67", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "lifetime-access-27", "drbeen-quarterly", "lifetime-discounted-50", "db-a-lifetime", "drbeen-uaprn", "db-uaprn-2018", "sellular-access", "special-been", "nc-been", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-49", "lifetime-access-49", "lifetime-access-49", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "free-trial-h", "student-monthly-22", "student-lifetime-access", "promotional-been", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-25", "lifetime-access-25", "lifetime-access-25", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "free-trial-account", "free-trial-account", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "monthly", "monthly", "monthly", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "drbeen-gift", "drbeen-gift", "drbeen-gift", "lifetime-access-67", "cvs-family-practice-package", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "yearly-special", "yearly-special", "yearly-special", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "summer-discount", "summer-discount", "summer-discount", "summer-discount" ], "status" : "enabled", "slug" : "nodal-action-potentials", "seq" : 22, "updatedAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-12T17:00:01.230+0000" }, "instructors" : [ { "orderNum" : 1, "user" : { "$oid" : "57c6515c1a4f528e46bc4708" }, "role" : "lead" } ], "access" : "subscription", "shortId" : "rJVlsG0O3e-", "datePublished" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "createdAt" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "keywords" : [  ], "learningObjectives" : [  ], "ratings" : [  ], "__v" : 1 },

Therefore, it is safe to say that the Vagus supply is limited to the two nodes and the atrial muscles only.&nbsp;PANS&nbsp;causes a marked decrease in heart rate (negative chronotropic effect) and a slight decrease in heart muscle contractility (negative inotropic effect).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (SANS)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, the sympathetic supply to the heart is global as it supplies the two nodes as well as the atrial and ventricular muscles.&nbsp;SANS increases the heart rate and the&nbsp;contractility of the myocardium i.e. positive chronotropic and inotropic effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RATE OF DISCHARGE OF NODAL TISSUE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a gradual increase in the RMP&nbsp;i.e.&nbsp;resting membrane potential&nbsp;of nodal tissues from -55mV to -40mV and this is referred to as the slope of depolarization. Phase 4 is followed by the Phase 0 of action potential. At -55mV, the fast sodium channels (also known as &#39;funny&#39; channels) are in a semi-open state which allows&nbsp;leakage of positive ions into the nodal cells. Leakage of&nbsp;sodium&nbsp;ions causes an increase in the membrane potential in the&nbsp;positive direction&nbsp;(towards 0). The membrane potential gradually increases to&nbsp;-40mV. Upon reaching this threshold potential, the sodium channels close and remain closed for the rest of the action potential as they enter a state of refractoriness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An increase in the slope of depolarization will cause the SA node to generate action potentials at a higher rate.

This results in&nbsp;an increase in the heart rate.&nbsp;The PANS, via the&nbsp;vagal stimulation, causes a decrease in the slope of depolarization&nbsp;which causes a delay in reaching the threshold potential for spontaneous depolarization. This subsequently&nbsp;results in an increase in the duration of action potential, thereby decreasing&nbsp;the heart rate(negative chronotropic effect).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, changes in ionic conduction across the cell membrane also cause&nbsp;changes in the heart rate. However, the part of action potential that undergoes changes relies on the type of ions involved:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Changes&nbsp;in sodium ion conduction cause&nbsp;a change&nbsp;in the slope of depolarization.

Hence, any changes in potassium ion conductance will affect the time taken for the nodal tissue&nbsp;to repolarize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Faster the conduction of&nbsp;the above mentioned&nbsp;ions across the cell membrane, higher would be the frequency of depolarizations&nbsp;and vice versa.&nbsp;Dromotropy is a property of the cardiac conducting system which determines the conduction velocity of impulses across the cardiac conduction system. Impulse velocity is determined by the conductance of above mentioned ions. SANS causes positive dromotropic effect, thereby increasing the conduction velocity across the conduction system of the heart. On the other hand, PANS results in a negative dromotropic effect. Negative dromotropic effect will result in decreased conduction velocity across the cardiac conduction system.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rate changes in the SA node occur mainly via&nbsp;the action of autonomic nervous&nbsp;system.&nbsp;Whereas, the AV node and rest of the conduction system&nbsp;exhibit changes in their rate of depolarizations&nbsp;secondary to the movement of ions across their cell membranes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TERMS USED TO DESCRIBE HEART RATE&nbsp;&amp; CONTRACTILITY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;Chronotropy:&nbsp;It refers to the rate of cardiac activity&nbsp;i.eheart rate<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>. For example, the parasympathetic nervous system causes negative chronotropy and the sympathetic nervous system causes positive chronotropy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;Dromotropy:&nbsp;This term is used to describe the velocity of conduction within the conducting fibers. Negative dromotropic agents decrease the velocity of conduction. Positive dromotropy occurs when there is an increase in the velocity of conduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3)&nbsp;Inotropy:&nbsp;This is a term used to describe the contractility of the cardiac musculature (ventricular muscle mainly). SANS has a positive inotropic effect whereas PANS stimulation has a mildly negative chronotropic effect which isn&rsquo;t that pronounced.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MECHANISM OF ACTION OF AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AT MOLECULAR LEVEL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Primary neurotransmitters (Acetylcholine in PANS stimulation and adrenaline or noradrenalin in SANS stimulation) activate the G-coupled proteins present on the cell membrane of the conducting tissues. This results in the detachment of intracellularly bonded alpha subunit of the G proteins which acts on the sodium and calcium channels. The channels get activated or deactivated depending on the type of stimulation that occurs initially.</p>\r\n", "locales" : [ { "languageCode" : "en-us", "source" : "23video", "referenceId" : "13433925", "referenceToken" : "486c067fa2ba0693be1e8996e461c4c8", "referenceLocationId" : "12732911", "authToken" : "0dcee4e0bffda849e5b5fc179b789e28" } ], "tags" : { "section" : "Physiology", "topic" : [ "physiology", "EKG Interpretation", "", "Essentials: EKG Analysis and Interpretation Series", "Physiology", "CVS Physiology", "Cardiovascular System Clinical Foundations" ], "info" : [ "foundational", "usmleStep1", "special", "cme" ], "subject" : "Physiology", "system" : "Cardiovascular System", "concentrations" : [  ], "keywords" : [  ], "practice" : [  ] }, "packages" : [ "prohealth", "drbeen-yearly-discount", "drbeen-yearly", "unlimited-cme", "unlimited-cme-intro", "unlimited-cme-uaprn", "uaprn-conference", "student-monthly", "student-yearly", "student-coffee-2016", "student-beans-2016", "np-sprout-2016", "stgeorge-sprout-2016", "professional-monthly", "professional-yearly", "drbeen-monthly", "limited-student-lifetime", "lifetime-plan", "lifetime-access-special", "lifetime-access-half-price", "lifetime-access-discount", "lifetime-access-promo", "lifetime-access", "lifetime-access-49", "drnajeeb-special", "drnajeeb-cme", "stgeorge-coffee-2016", "np-coffee-2016", "stgeorge-bean-2016", "np-beans-2016", "al-ahli-hospital-pilot", "aanp-special-drnajeeb", "aanp-2017-yearly-access", "aanp-2017-lifetime-access", "monthly", "yearly", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-electives", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "usmle-step-1", "usmle-step-1", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-79", "drbeen-yearly-49", "lifetime-access-1", "lifetime-access-1", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-67", "lifetime-access-67", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "lifetime-access-27", "drbeen-quarterly", "lifetime-discounted-50", "db-a-lifetime", "drbeen-uaprn", "db-uaprn-2018", "sellular-access", "special-been", "nc-been", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-49", "lifetime-access-49", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "free-trial-h", "student-monthly-22", "student-lifetime-access", "promotional-been", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-25", "lifetime-access-25", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "free-trial-account", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "monthly", "monthly", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "drbeen-gift", "drbeen-gift", "lifetime-access-67", "cvs-family-practice-package", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "yearly-special", "yearly-special", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "summer-discount", "summer-discount", "summer-discount" ], "status" : "enabled", "slug" : "autonomic-control-of-the-nodal-action-potentials", "seq" : 23, "updatedAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-12T17:00:01.230+0000" }, "instructors" : [ { "orderNum" : 1, "user" : { "$oid" : "57c6515c1a4f528e46bc4708" }, "role" : "lead" } ], "access" : "subscription", "shortId" : "HyHxszROhlZ", "datePublished" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "createdAt" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "keywords" : [  ], "learningObjectives" : [  ], "ratings" : [  ], "__v" : 1 },

Therefore, there is a passive movement of sodium ions into the cell as the channels open. The sodium channels are&nbsp;voltage&nbsp;gated as they undergo&nbsp;conformational change&nbsp;in response to differences in potential across the membrane. The sodium channels have two types of gates that control the passage of sodium ions; the &#39;H&#39; gate&nbsp;or inactivation gate&nbsp;and the &#39;M&#39; gate. At resting stage, the M gate is closed and the H gate is open. Upon stimulation by an action potential, the M gate opens and the channels become active, allowing sodium ions to travel into the cell. This opening of the channels is limited by time. After a fraction of a second, the H gates close spontaneously rendering the channels inactive. The sodium channels enter a refractory period during which they cannot be activated no matter how strong is the stimulus. At the same time, the M gatecloses&nbsp;as well. As soon as the refractory period ends, the H&nbsp;gate&nbsp;opens&nbsp;and the sodium channels are restored to their&nbsp;initial&nbsp;inactive state.&nbsp;It is called &ldquo;De-inactivation&rdquo;The M gates remain closed till the arrival of the next action potential and the cycle is repeated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different states of the fast sodium channels and relative conformational states of the H and M gates are summarized in the table below:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>SODIUM CHANNEL STATE</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>M-GATE (ACTIVATION GATE)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>H-GATE (INACTIVATION GATE)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Closed (Resting state)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Closed</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Open</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Open (Active state)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Open</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Open</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Inactivated</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Open</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Closed</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;Potassium Channels: Physiologically, the cells are loaded with potassium ions. The concentration of potassium ions is&nbsp;relatively&nbsp;greater inside the cell. As a result, they tend to move out of the cell from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentrationbut because of negativity inside cells which is due to negatively&nbsp;charged proteins&nbsp;it stops moving out&nbsp;until -94 mV is the potential difference across the membrane.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are four types of potassium channels:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Potassium Leaky Channels: these are independent of any external factors and allow a constant leakage of potassium ions out of the cell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Inward Rectifying Potassium Channels (IK1): These channels are voltage gated and they open or close&nbsp;in response to changes in membrane potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Inward Delayed Rectifying Potassium Channels: Also&nbsp;voltage&nbsp;gated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Inward Rectifying Transient Potassium Channels: Open transiently for a very small amount of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3)&nbsp;Calcium Channels: The calcium ions tend to move inside the cell as they are present in greater amounts outside the cell. They are classified as fast and slow calcium channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4)&nbsp;Na/K ATPase: These are ATP dependent transmembrane&nbsp;proteins&nbsp;that actively pump sodium and potassium ions against their concentration gradient.&nbsp;3 sodium ions are pumped out of the cell in exchange for 2 potassium ions into the cell.&nbsp;This creates&nbsp;a negative balance across the cell membrane which also corresponds to the negativeResting membrane potential i.e.&nbsp;RMP&nbsp;inside most cells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ROLE OF IONIC CHANNELS DURING AN ACTION POTENTIAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;Rest State/Phase 4 of Action Potential: The Na/K ATPase works at the expense of energy to keep the resting membrane potential -90mV. Potassium leaky channels allow passive movement of potassium ions out of the cell in order to prevent excess negativity inside the cell and maintain the RMP.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;Rapid Depolarization/Phase 0 of Action Potential: Upon stimulation, the voltage dependent M gates of sodium channels open and rapidly allow sodium entry into the cells. An immediate spike in the&nbsp;positivedirection is observed. The membrane potential rises from&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;-90mV to +20mV. At this point, the H gates close and the sodium channels become refractory. The leaky potassium channels&nbsp;remain open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3)&nbsp;Transient Repolarization/Phase 1 of Action Potential: The inward&nbsp;rectifying&nbsp;transient potassium channels open. This happens for a very brief period of time during which potassium ions move out of the cell. A consequent drop in membrane potential is observed.&nbsp;Significance of phase 1 is Ito channels transiently open and then close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4)&nbsp;Plateau/Phase 2 of Action Potential: The membrane potential remains constant during this part of the cycle as the resultant movement of ions&nbsp;in opposite&nbsp;directions balances the&nbsp;charge&nbsp;across the membrane. The calcium channels were triggered to open along with sodium ions at the start of the action potential. Due to their slow nature, the calcium channels take time to open. Opening of these channels and the movement of calcium ions inside the cell will oppose the negative charge produced by movement of potassium ions out of the cell. The movement of potassium ions is conducted by delayed rectifying potassium channels,&nbsp;<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>leaky channels and rectifying channel. Hence, the membrane potential is maintained at a constant value the entire time the calcium channels remain open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5)&nbsp;Repolarization/Phase 3 of Action Potential: At the end of Phase 2, the calcium channels start to close. The inward rectifying potassium channels open and along with the already open delayed rectifying potassium channels, they conduct potassium outflow. This would&nbsp;create a burst of positive charge leaving the cell. The membrane potential falls back to the RMP. The Na/K ATPase are reactivated to maintain RMP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "locales" : [ { "languageCode" : "en-us", "source" : "23video", "referenceId" : "13434065", "referenceToken" : "fa4e08d80bfa9269c57b9f7a456e2309", "referenceLocationId" : "12732911", "authToken" : "80490427aff12c143286afaa6a79ea00" } ], "tags" : { "section" : "Physiology", "topic" : [ "physiology", "EKG Interpretation", "", "Essentials: EKG Analysis and Interpretation Series", "Physiology", "Cardiovascular System Clinical Foundations" ], "info" : [ "foundational", "usmleStep1", "cme" ], "subject" : "Physiology", "system" : "Cardiovascular System", "concentrations" : [  ], "keywords" : [  ], "practice" : [  ] }, "packages" : [ "prohealth", "drbeen-yearly-discount", "drbeen-yearly", "unlimited-cme", "unlimited-cme-intro", "unlimited-cme-uaprn", "uaprn-conference", "student-monthly", "student-yearly", "student-coffee-2016", "student-beans-2016", "np-sprout-2016", "stgeorge-sprout-2016", "professional-monthly", "professional-yearly", "drbeen-monthly", "limited-student-lifetime", "lifetime-plan", "lifetime-access-special", "lifetime-access-half-price", "lifetime-access-discount", "lifetime-access-promo", "lifetime-access", "lifetime-access-49", "drnajeeb-special", "drnajeeb-cme", "stgeorge-coffee-2016", "np-coffee-2016", "stgeorge-bean-2016", "np-beans-2016", "al-ahli-hospital-pilot", "aanp-special-drnajeeb", "aanp-2017-yearly-access", "aanp-2017-lifetime-access", "monthly", "yearly", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-electives", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "usmle-step-1", "usmle-step-1", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-79", "drbeen-yearly-49", "lifetime-access-1", "lifetime-access-1", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-67", "lifetime-access-67", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "lifetime-access-27", "drbeen-quarterly", "lifetime-discounted-50", "db-a-lifetime", "drbeen-uaprn", "db-uaprn-2018", "sellular-access", "special-been", "nc-been", "lifetime-access-49", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "free-trial-h", "student-monthly-22", "student-lifetime-access", "promotional-been", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-25", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "monthly", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "drbeen-gift", "cvs-family-practice-package", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "yearly-special", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "summer-discount", "summer-discount" ], "status" : "enabled", "slug" : "ventricular-action-potentials", "seq" : 24, "updatedAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-12T17:00:01.231+0000" }, "instructors" : [ { "orderNum" : 1, "user" : { "$oid" : "57c6515c1a4f528e46bc4708" }, "role" : "lead" } ], "access" : "subscription", "shortId" : "S1IxsMAdhxZ", "datePublished" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "createdAt" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:36.000+0000" }, "keywords" : [  ], "learningObjectives" : [  ], "ratings" : [  ], "__v" : 1 },

These 4 chambers are divided into 2 functional units referred to as the left heart and the right heart. These atria and ventricle in a single functional unit are separated by the atrioventricular valves. These AV valves are one way valves and allow blood flow in the forward direction only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right heart is formed by the right atrium and the right ventricle, and it forms one functional unit. The right atrium receives the venous deoxygenated blood from three sources, namely:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;Superior vena cava: brings deoxygenated blood from the head, neck and upper limb region</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;Inferior vena cava: brings deoxygenated blood from the lower extremities, the abdominal region and the rest of the body except the heart itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3)&nbsp;Coronary sinus: brings deoxygenated blood from the veins of the heart itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During diastole when the atria contract, this deoxygenated blood is pumped into the right ventricle. During systole, the right ventricle pumps this deoxygenated blood out of the heart and into the pulmonary circuit via the pulmonary artery*. The right heart plus the pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins together form the pulmonary circulation. The right side of the heart deals with deoxygenated blood only and it functions to send this deoxygenated blood to the pulmonary circulation to get oxygenated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Left heart forms another functional unit and consists of the left atrium and left ventricle. The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the pulmonary circuit via the 4 pulmonary veins*(two from each lung). When the atria contract, the left atrium pumps this oxygenated blood into the left ventricle. During systole, this oxygenated blood is pumped out of the heart via aorta, when the left ventricle contracts. The aorta then carries this oxygenated blood intothe systemic circulation. The left heart plus the systemic arteries (starting at the aorta), capillaries and veins together form the systemic circulation. For simplicity, it can be assumed that the left heart deals with the oxygenated blood and sends it to the systemic&nbsp;circulation&nbsp;via the aorta.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOTE: Arteries conduct blood away from the heart towards the tissues. Arteries normally carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, but an exception to this rule are the pulmonary arteries and&nbsp;the umbilical arteries(during fetal life only)&nbsp;which carry deoxygenated blood away from the heart and toward the lungs&nbsp;&amp; placenta respectively. Veins normally carry deoxygenated blood, except the pulmonary veins in adults&nbsp;and the umbilical vein (during fetal life only)&nbsp;which bring back oxygenated blood to the heart from the lungs&nbsp;and the placenta respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SYSTEMIC TISSUES:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the systemic perfusion, the oxygenated blood in the aorta is eventually transported to the following 6 major systemic tissues. These systemic tissues receive blood via a parallel system of arteries which originate at various levels from the aorta itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;Cerebral:&nbsp;The CNS plus the head &amp; neck region.&nbsp;15% of the cardiac output enters the cerebral arteries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;Coronary: The myocardium itself which receives oxygenated blood during diastole in contrast to the rest of the body which receives oxygenated blood as part of systole. 5% of the total cardiac output is designated for the myocardial perfusion via the kidneys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3)&nbsp;Splanchnic:&nbsp;The gastrointestinal system and its accessory organs such as the liver, spleen, pancreas&nbsp;and the biliary&nbsp;system.&nbsp;25% of the total cardiac output reaches the GIT system via the splanchnic arteries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4)&nbsp;Renal:&nbsp;The kidneys and the genitourinary system.&nbsp;Kidneys, as part of the renal system, receive 25% of the total cardiac output.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5)&nbsp;Skeletal:&nbsp;Roughly 25% of the total cardiac output is reaches the skeletal system. Exercise increases the percentage of cardiac output which is made available for the skeletal system.&nbsp;Bones and the musculature of the body form part of this system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6)&nbsp;Cutaneous:&nbsp;The skin and its associated structures (sebaceous glands, hair follicles). Around&nbsp;5% of the total cardiac output reaches the cutaneous circulation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BLOOD FLOW DIRECTION &amp; THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE VENOUS &amp; ARTERIAL BLOOD:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are 4 pulmonary veins which bring back oxygenated blood from the lungs to left atrium. This blood is rich in oxygen&nbsp;(PaO2=100 mm Hg)&nbsp;and low in carbon&nbsp;dioxide(PaCO2=40 mm Hg). The mitral valve which forms the left atrioventricular valve, allows passage of blood from the left atrium into the left ventricle during the diastole phase. When the left ventricle begins to contract and its pressure rises more than the left atrial pressure, the mitral valve closes to prevent backflow of the blood. This ensures anterograde flow of blood in to the aorta i.e., the forward direction of blood flow. Backflow from the aorta back into the left atrium is prevented by the semilunar aortic valve. It&#39;s important to remember that all the valves of the heart are tricuspid i.e., having three cusps, except the mitral valve which is bicuspid i.e., having two cusps. However, only the right atrioventricular valve is referred to as the tricuspid valve.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the aorta, the blood is transported to the systemic tissues which are mentioned above. The aorta divides into large and medium sized arteries, which eventually give arise the arterioles. The arterioles&nbsp;continue&nbsp;to form capillaries, and these capillaries merge together to form venules at their venous ends. The venules eventually end up forming the veins.&nbsp;The veins are low pressure vessels which return the deoxygenated blood back to the right heart via the three above mentioned sources&nbsp;of venous return to the heart. This deoxygenated blood is low in oxygen&nbsp;(40 mm Hg)&nbsp;and rich in carbon dioxide&nbsp;(47 mm Hg). The right atrioventricular valve, which is also referred to as the tricuspid valve, allows this deoxygenated blood to flow from the right atrium into the right ventricle. During ventricular systole when the leftventricle contracts, this&nbsp;deoxygenated blood is pumped out ofthe right side of the heart via the pulmonary artery. The backflow of this deoxygenated blood into the right side of the heart during ventricular diastole is prevented by the semilunar pulmonary valve. This deoxygenated blood reaches the lungs and enters the pulmonary circuit to get&nbsp;oxygenated&nbsp;At this point the blood completes&nbsp;its route both around the&nbsp;pulmonary and systemic circuits. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SERIES &amp; PARALLEL CIRCUITS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The right and left sides of the heart are connected&nbsp;in a series circuit&nbsp;to&nbsp;both&nbsp;the pulmonary and systemic tissues respectively. By series circuit, what&#39;s meant here is that quantitatively, the blood flow through the lungs is equal to the blood flow through the rest of the body. For simplicity in understanding, it should be considered that the lungs are connected to the rest of the body in a series&nbsp;circuit. During a single cardiac cycle, the right and left ventricular outputs are the same.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the blood supply of the systemic tissues is connected in a parallel circuit. This means that each organ system is supplied by an artery which originates as a branch of the aorta. This ensures that the blood which reaches a particular organ system is perfused at the same partial pressure of oxygen, as that of the site at which the branch originated&nbsp;from the aorta. If the organ systems were connected and perfused via a series circuit, by the time the blood reached the last organ system, it would have been completely depleted of oxygen and nutrients. The sum of blood flow to these individual systems adds up to the total left ventricular output (the cardiac output).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>VARIOUS PRESSURES IN THE CVS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (SBP):&nbsp;Systole is time interval when the ventricles are contracting. Systolic BP therefore is the pressure in the systemic arteries when the left ventricle is contracting. Therefore, SBP is the highest blood pressure in the systemic arteries during a cardiac cycle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Average SBP in healthy adults is 120 mm of Hg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;DIASTOLIC BLOOD&nbsp;PRESSURE (DBP):&nbsp;Diastole is the time interval when the ventricles are relaxing and therefore receiving blood from the atria. Diastolic BP is the pressure in the systemic arteries when the left ventricle is relaxing.&nbsp;DBP&nbsp;therefore is the lowest pressure in systemic arteries during a cardiac cycle. Average DBP in healthy adults is 80 mm of Hg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;PULSE PRESSURE&nbsp;(PP):&nbsp;This is the difference between the&nbsp;systolic&nbsp;blood pressure and the diastolic blood pressure in the systemic arteries at any given time. Pulse pressure can therefore be calculated as following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>➢&nbsp;Pulse pressure, PP = Difference between the systolic &amp; diastolic blood pressures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PP= SBP- DBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PP&nbsp;= 120-80= 40 mm of Hg</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Variations in pulse pressure can be in anaemia, fever, blood loss etc. Narrow pulse pressure can be seen when there is blood loss,&nbsp;aortic regurgitation. Pulse pressure widens during exercise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;MEAN ARTERIAL PRESSURE:&nbsp;MAP is the average arterial pressure of the systemic arteries. However,&nbsp;quantitatively&nbsp;it&#39;s not an&nbsp;arithmetic&nbsp;mean of the SBP &amp; DBP.&nbsp;Since the ventricular muscle spends 2/3 of the time of a cardiac cycle in diastole, the MAP is closer to the DBP, than it&#39;s to the SBP.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MAP signifies the perfusion pressure of the tissues. If the MAP of the patient decreases below 60 mm of Hg, then it should be a cause of concern for the doctor.

Our skin is multilayered and keratinized. This structure prevents the entry of bacteria, fungi, and viruses from entering deeper tissues. The superficial layers of keratinization and dead cells are protective as well. Pathogens get stuck in these layers and are removed when these layers are shed. Mucous membranes of the conjunctiva, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory system, urogenital and reproductive system have surfaces with secretions covering the epithelium. The moist surfaces have chemical substances and enzymes that can attach with pathogens and prevent these pathogens from entering the deeper tissues. Cilia are also present on some of the surfaces, pathogens can become stuck on these ciliary surfaces. In these situations, pathogens are removed as the cilia propel and move the pathogens to the exit. Also of interest is that on these mucosal surfaces, there are proteins called defensins that can identify a foreign pathogen and create holes in the membrane of the pathogen to destroy it before it enters our body and harms us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "isPublished" : true },

Consolidated alveoli mean fluid-filled alveoli. An x-ray will show the congestion; clinical presentation will also reflect this congestion.&nbsp;Streptococcus pneumoniae is the main pathogen we will look at.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>People with chronic diseases like COPD, HTN, and Diabetes. Asplenic patients are also at a high risk. The reason is that macrophages in the spleen filter out the capsular pathogens like pneumococci. Asplenic patients do not have these macrophages sitting in one place and hunting these pathogens.</li>\r\n\t<li>Groups on the age extreme i.e. older people and children are also at risk of pneumonia.</li>\r\n\t<li>People who develop upper respiratory infections (common cold for example) can develop pneumonia.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Presentation and Clinical Findings</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Sudden onset of high-grade fever. The patient may complain of common cold, lethargy, and then the sudden development of high-grade fever, dyspnea, breathlessness, etc.</li>\r\n\t<li>Dullness on percussion is observed due to the filled areas of lungs.</li>\r\n\t<li>Vocal fremitus is observed.</li>\r\n\t<li>Bronchophony will be present.</li>\r\n\t<li>Egophony will be present. (E will sound like A when heard through a stethoscope.)</li>\r\n\t<li>Inspiratory crackles will be observed. (Crackles at the end of the inspiration.)</li>\r\n\t<li>Bronchial breathing will be observed, instead of vesicular breathing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Pneumococcus</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Lancet shaped pathogen.</li>\r\n\t<li>Usually diplococci.</li>\r\n\t<li>Capsular.</li>\r\n\t<li>India Ink test is positive.</li>\r\n\t<li>Gram-positive.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually, pneumococcus enters the lungs from the oropharyngeal aspirate or through the aerosol of other people.

Cardiovascular development occurs during the 3rd to 5th week of intraembryonic life. Up until the second week,&nbsp;diffusion is enough for embryo to receive&nbsp;the oxygen,&nbsp;nutrition&nbsp;and to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;the&nbsp;waste products.&nbsp;The lacunae of maternal blood filled spaces and embryonic villi of the syncytio-trophoblast are involved in an intimate&nbsp;relationship, which&nbsp;allows gaseous exchange via diffusion in between the developing embryo and the maternal blood. However, into the third&nbsp;week,&nbsp;diffusion alone&nbsp;is not&nbsp;sufficient to match the needs of the growing embryo and it needs a&nbsp;circulatory system, hence heart has to develop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GASTRULA STAGE:&nbsp;Gastrula is a stage of development of embryo, when it&nbsp;is in&nbsp;the&nbsp;form of tri-laminar germ disc including ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. Endoderm is associated with umbilical vesicle; ectoderm is associated with Amniotic cavity. Cytotrophoblast around the gastrula develops multiple&nbsp;cavities. The cavities merge to form one big cavity called extraembryonic coelom. The cytotrophoblast is connected to embryo through the connecting stalk. The cellular layer from cytotrophoblast which covers the gastrula is called extraembryonic mesoderm. The Gastrula is a slipper shaped structure. From the dorsal view it has a neural plate with a primitive node a primitive pit and a&nbsp;primitive&nbsp;groove. Cranial side has a Buccopharyngeal membrane which would later develop into mouth. Caudal end has a cloacal membrane which would develop into anus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HEART FORMING&nbsp;REGIONS:&nbsp;Around 15th day of intraembryonic life, multiple&nbsp;cavitations start&nbsp;appearing in the lateral plate mesoderm which later merge together to form&nbsp;a Horseshoe-shaped Intraembryonic&nbsp;Coelom. The Horseshoe shaped Coelom divides lateral plate mesoderm into two layers which are called Splanchnopleure (connected to underlying Endoderm) and Somatopleure (connected to overlying Ectoderm).&nbsp;It&rsquo;s&nbsp;the splanchnic layer of mesoderm which mainly forms the cardiogenic area in the latter half of the 3rd week. In addition to this, Neural crest cells also contribute to heart formation especially the Aorticopulmonary septum and the Endocardial Cushion regions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 17the day of intraembryonic life, the Endoderm layer of the Gastrula secretes VEGF, which causes Ectodermal cells to migrate into the cranial end of the underlying mesoderm and form Blood&nbsp;islands. A&nbsp;horseshoe shaped area forms on either side of the neural plate. The blood islands formed above the Prechordial plate (Cranial side) are&nbsp;called PrimaryCardiogenic or Heart-forming regions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CRANIAL &amp; LATERAL BODY FOLDINGS:&nbsp;By the 17-18 days brain starts developing at a faster pace and overtakes the&nbsp;body&rsquo;s&nbsp;growth so that the heart descends downwards to the chest&nbsp;region. Cephalic-caudal Body folding ensures that the&nbsp;cardiogenic&nbsp;area and septum Transversum (future diaphragm) come to lie under and below the prechordal plate and&nbsp;in frontof the foregut.&nbsp;The heart hangs from the foregut by a connection called prechordium.Lateral body folding approximates the intraembryonic coelom in the midline, folds of which give rise to adult pericardial sacs which envelope the cardiogenic area in the midline.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DEVELOPMENT OF PRIMITIVE HEART TUBES: The ectodermal cells migrate into the mesoderm as&nbsp;cardiogeniccells which condense to form a pair of primordial Heart&nbsp;tubes. The&nbsp;pharyngeal area mesoderm contributes further cells which form a secondary heart forming region around the primordial heart tubes. Further cells are contributed the Splanchnic Mesoderm which form the myocardium around the primordial heart tubes. This newly formed Myocardium will start secreting&nbsp;Hyaluronic acid and other connective tissue components which are termed together and called as Cardiac Jelly. Cardiac jelly in future becomes the connective tissue of the heart. These newly formed primordial heart tubes are surrounded by pericardial cavity which provides the outer Parietal layer of the Pericardium which is adherent to the Fibrous pericardium in the adult heart. The Caudal or Inflow part of the Heart tube that is Sinus Venosus provides the cells which form the visceral or inner layer of pericardium, also called EPICARDIUM. By the 21st day the two primordial heart tubes fuse&nbsp;by apoptosis&nbsp;into a single endocardial or Heart tube. On 22nd day the&nbsp;embryonic&nbsp;heart starts beating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DILATATIONS &amp; DERIVATIVES OF THE HEART TUBE: The Primordial heart tube now orients itself into a cephalic INFLOW (Venous region) and a cranial OUTFLOW (Arterial Region) ends. At this point the&nbsp;primitive&nbsp;heart tube has five dilatations which are as following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Truncus Arteriosus (Arterial Outflow region): Forms Adult Aorta, Pulmonary trunk and their respective semilunar valves.</li>\r\n\t<li>Bulbus Cordis: Forms Smooth parts of Adult right ventricle (conus arteriosus) and left ventricle (aortic vestibule).</li>\r\n\t<li>Primitive Ventricle: Forms trabeculated/rough parts of right and left ventricles.</li>\r\n\t<li>Primitive Atrium: Forms trabeculated/rough parts of right and left atriums&nbsp;i.e., the pectinate muscles.</li>\r\n\t<li>Sinus Venosus: On the right side it forms Sinus Venarum (smooth part of right Atrium), Superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava. On the left side it forms Coronary sinus&nbsp;and oblique vein of left atrium.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: (a) The vascular parts when incorporated into the adult heart form the smooth regions of the heart whereas the primitive chambers form the rough or trabeculated parts of the respective adult heart chambers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(b) Incorporation of parts of the Pulmonary veins forms the smooth-walled part of the left Atrium. On the right side, incorporation of right sinus venosus forms the smooth-walled part of right atrium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DEXTRAL LOOPING: The heart tube at this point undergoes Right sided bending or rotation which referred to as Dextral looping. The Truncus Arteriosus or the&nbsp;ventricularend of the heart tube grows more rapidly and tends to&nbsp;fold downwards, forwards and to the right side. Subsequently, the lower parts of the&nbsp;tube i.e., the primitive atria and sinus venosus tend to fold upwards, backwards and to the left side. This dextral looping tends to place the chambers of heart in their adult anatomic positions where the right ventricle forms most of the right border plus the anterior surface of the heart and the left atrium is the&nbsp;posterior&nbsp;most chamber of the heart. Also, the ventricles are rather more anteriorly placed relative to atria in an adult heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE ROLE OF LEVO-DYNEIN, DEXTROCARDIA, SITUS INVERSUS &amp; KARTEGENER SYNDROME: Levo-Dynein is a protein which involved in the formation of Cilia. However, Levo-Dynein also functions to create symmetry within the human body. An abnormality of Levo-dynein can lead to symmetry problems such as, Situs Inversus whereas the visceras tend to be present on the opposite sides of their normal anatomical location. It can also lead to Dextrocardia, which is a rare clinical condition in which the Apex of the heart is located on the right side of the body. The above two abnormalities often present as part of Kartagener Syndrome (Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia). Kartagener Syndrome&nbsp;results due to a defect in the dynein arm of the cilia which renders cilia immotile. It is a cause of infertility in both males and females due to immotile sperm&nbsp;and dysfunctional fallopian tube cilia&nbsp;respectively. In females there&#39;s an additional risk of ectopic pregnancies. Besides Dextrocardia on CXR and infertility in both sexes, Kartagener Syndrome can also lead to Bronchiectasis and recurrent sinusitis due to&nbsp;ineffectiveness&nbsp;of mucociliary escalator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MESOCORDIUM &amp; TRANSVERSE SINUS: Post the cranial-caudal body folding, the&nbsp;embryonic heart tubes come to lie&nbsp;in front&nbsp;of the foregut. This is before the fusion of the primordial heart tubes into a single Heart tube. At this point the primordial heart tubes are connected to the foregut via the Mesocordium. The Mesocordium itself is a derivative of peritoneum.&nbsp;Subsequently, a gap appears within the Mesocordium which is called transverse sinus and this eventually results in degeneration of Mesocordium, following which the Pericardial&nbsp;cavity is thus separated from&nbsp;the Foregut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TERATOGENS EXPOSURE:&nbsp;Teratogens are substances (normally drugs) which can either cause birth defects or they can accelerate other embryonic deformities that are present.&nbsp;Developing embryo is most susceptible to&nbsp;teratogens&nbsp;exposure during its embryonic period&nbsp;which is&nbsp;from 3rd to&nbsp;8th week (first 2 months).This is because the embryonic period is the time when most organ systems are&nbsp;developing;&nbsp;hence teratogen exposure at this point can be&nbsp;disastrous.&nbsp;Teratogens frequently tested by the USMLE are given below:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>ACE Inhibitors: Cause Renal damage</li>\r\n\t<li>Aminoglycosides: Cranial nerve 8, Vestibulocochlear Nerve Abnormalities.</li>\r\n\t<li>Carbamazepine: Facial dysmorphism, developmental delay and neural tube defects.</li>\r\n\t<li>Lithium (used to treat the&nbsp;manic&nbsp;phase of Bipolar disorder): Ebstein Anomaly in which the tricuspid valve leaflets are displaced inferiorly into the right ventricle. It presents with widely split S2 and Tricuspid Regurgitation.</li>\r\n\t<li>Phenytoin: Can cause fetal Hydantoin syndrome i.e., cleft palate, cardiac defects and phalanx or fingernail hypoplasia.</li>\r\n\t<li>Tetracyclines: Discoloration of teeth.</li>\r\n\t<li>Thalidomide: Limb defects.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>ROLE OF RETIONOIC ACID: Increased retinoic acid concentration in an area of blood vessel formation leads to formation of a venous channel.

Cardiovascular development occurs during the 3rd to 5th week of intraembryonic life. Up until the second week,&nbsp;diffusion is enough for embryo to receive&nbsp;the oxygen,&nbsp;nutrition&nbsp;and to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;the&nbsp;waste products.&nbsp;The lacunae of maternal blood filled spaces and embryonic villi of the syncytio-trophoblast are involved in an intimate&nbsp;relationship, which&nbsp;allows gaseous exchange via diffusion in between the developing embryo and the maternal blood. However, into the third&nbsp;week,&nbsp;diffusion alone&nbsp;is not&nbsp;sufficient to match the needs of the growing embryo and it needs a&nbsp;circulatory system, hence heart has to develop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GASTRULA STAGE:&nbsp;Gastrula is a stage of development of embryo, when it&nbsp;is in&nbsp;the&nbsp;form of tri-laminar germ disc including ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. Endoderm is associated with umbilical vesicle; ectoderm is associated with Amniotic cavity. Cytotrophoblast around the gastrula develops multiple&nbsp;cavities. The cavities merge to form one big cavity called extraembryonic coelom. The cytotrophoblast is connected to embryo through the connecting stalk. The cellular layer from cytotrophoblast which covers the gastrula is called extraembryonic mesoderm. The Gastrula is a slipper shaped structure. From the dorsal view it has a neural plate with a primitive node a primitive pit and a&nbsp;primitive&nbsp;groove. Cranial side has a Buccopharyngeal membrane which would later develop into mouth. Caudal end has a cloacal membrane which would develop into anus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HEART FORMING&nbsp;REGIONS:&nbsp;Around 15th day of intraembryonic life, multiple&nbsp;cavitations start&nbsp;appearing in the lateral plate mesoderm which later merge together to form&nbsp;a Horseshoe-shaped Intraembryonic&nbsp;Coelom. The Horseshoe shaped Coelom divides lateral plate mesoderm into two layers which are called Splanchnopleure (connected to underlying Endoderm) and Somatopleure (connected to overlying Ectoderm).&nbsp;It&rsquo;s&nbsp;the splanchnic layer of mesoderm which mainly forms the cardiogenic area in the latter half of the 3rd week. In addition to this, Neural crest cells also contribute to heart formation especially the Aorticopulmonary septum and the Endocardial Cushion regions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 17the day of intraembryonic life, the Endoderm layer of the Gastrula secretes VEGF, which causes Ectodermal cells to migrate into the cranial end of the underlying mesoderm and form Blood&nbsp;islands. A&nbsp;horseshoe shaped area forms on either side of the neural plate. The blood islands formed above the Prechordial plate (Cranial side) are&nbsp;called PrimaryCardiogenic or Heart-forming regions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CRANIAL &amp; LATERAL BODY FOLDINGS:&nbsp;By the 17-18 days brain starts developing at a faster pace and overtakes the&nbsp;body&rsquo;s&nbsp;growth so that the heart descends downwards to the chest&nbsp;region. Cephalic-caudal Body folding ensures that the&nbsp;cardiogenic&nbsp;area and septum Transversum (future diaphragm) come to lie under and below the prechordal plate and&nbsp;in frontof the foregut.&nbsp;The heart hangs from the foregut by a connection called prechordium.Lateral body folding approximates the intraembryonic coelom in the midline, folds of which give rise to adult pericardial sacs which envelope the cardiogenic area in the midline.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DEVELOPMENT OF PRIMITIVE HEART TUBES: The ectodermal cells migrate into the mesoderm as&nbsp;cardiogeniccells which condense to form a pair of primordial Heart&nbsp;tubes. The&nbsp;pharyngeal area mesoderm contributes further cells which form a secondary heart forming region around the primordial heart tubes. Further cells are contributed the Splanchnic Mesoderm which form the myocardium around the primordial heart tubes. This newly formed Myocardium will start secreting&nbsp;Hyaluronic acid and other connective tissue components which are termed together and called as Cardiac Jelly. Cardiac jelly in future becomes the connective tissue of the heart. These newly formed primordial heart tubes are surrounded by pericardial cavity which provides the outer Parietal layer of the Pericardium which is adherent to the Fibrous pericardium in the adult heart. The Caudal or Inflow part of the Heart tube that is Sinus Venosus provides the cells which form the visceral or inner layer of pericardium, also called EPICARDIUM. By the 21st day the two primordial heart tubes fuse&nbsp;by apoptosis&nbsp;into a single endocardial or Heart tube. On 22nd day the&nbsp;embryonic&nbsp;heart starts beating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DILATATIONS &amp; DERIVATIVES OF THE HEART TUBE: The Primordial heart tube now orients itself into a cephalic INFLOW (Venous region) and a cranial OUTFLOW (Arterial Region) ends. At this point the&nbsp;primitive&nbsp;heart tube has five dilatations which are as following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Truncus Arteriosus (Arterial Outflow region): Forms Adult Aorta, Pulmonary trunk and their respective semilunar valves.</li>\r\n\t<li>Bulbus Cordis: Forms Smooth parts of Adult right ventricle (conus arteriosus) and left ventricle (aortic vestibule).</li>\r\n\t<li>Primitive Ventricle: Forms trabeculated/rough parts of right and left ventricles.</li>\r\n\t<li>Primitive Atrium: Forms trabeculated/rough parts of right and left atriums&nbsp;i.e., the pectinate muscles.</li>\r\n\t<li>Sinus Venosus: On the right side it forms Sinus Venarum (smooth part of right Atrium), Superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava. On the left side it forms Coronary sinus&nbsp;and oblique vein of left atrium.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: (a) The vascular parts when incorporated into the adult heart form the smooth regions of the heart whereas the primitive chambers form the rough or trabeculated parts of the respective adult heart chambers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(b) Incorporation of parts of the Pulmonary veins forms the smooth-walled part of the left Atrium. On the right side, incorporation of right sinus venosus forms the smooth-walled part of right atrium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DEXTRAL LOOPING: The heart tube at this point undergoes Right sided bending or rotation which referred to as Dextral looping. The Truncus Arteriosus or the&nbsp;ventricularend of the heart tube grows more rapidly and tends to&nbsp;fold downwards, forwards and to the right side. Subsequently, the lower parts of the&nbsp;tube i.e., the primitive atria and sinus venosus tend to fold upwards, backwards and to the left side. This dextral looping tends to place the chambers of heart in their adult anatomic positions where the right ventricle forms most of the right border plus the anterior surface of the heart and the left atrium is the&nbsp;posterior&nbsp;most chamber of the heart. Also, the ventricles are rather more anteriorly placed relative to atria in an adult heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE ROLE OF LEVO-DYNEIN, DEXTROCARDIA, SITUS INVERSUS &amp; KARTEGENER SYNDROME: Levo-Dynein is a protein which involved in the formation of Cilia. However, Levo-Dynein also functions to create symmetry within the human body. An abnormality of Levo-dynein can lead to symmetry problems such as, Situs Inversus whereas the visceras tend to be present on the opposite sides of their normal anatomical location. It can also lead to Dextrocardia, which is a rare clinical condition in which the Apex of the heart is located on the right side of the body. The above two abnormalities often present as part of Kartagener Syndrome (Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia). Kartagener Syndrome&nbsp;results due to a defect in the dynein arm of the cilia which renders cilia immotile. It is a cause of infertility in both males and females due to immotile sperm&nbsp;and dysfunctional fallopian tube cilia&nbsp;respectively. In females there&#39;s an additional risk of ectopic pregnancies. Besides Dextrocardia on CXR and infertility in both sexes, Kartagener Syndrome can also lead to Bronchiectasis and recurrent sinusitis due to&nbsp;ineffectiveness&nbsp;of mucociliary escalator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MESOCORDIUM &amp; TRANSVERSE SINUS: Post the cranial-caudal body folding, the&nbsp;embryonic heart tubes come to lie&nbsp;in front&nbsp;of the foregut. This is before the fusion of the primordial heart tubes into a single Heart tube. At this point the primordial heart tubes are connected to the foregut via the Mesocordium. The Mesocordium itself is a derivative of peritoneum.&nbsp;Subsequently, a gap appears within the Mesocordium which is called transverse sinus and this eventually results in degeneration of Mesocordium, following which the Pericardial&nbsp;cavity is thus separated from&nbsp;the Foregut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TERATOGENS EXPOSURE:&nbsp;Teratogens are substances (normally drugs) which can either cause birth defects or they can accelerate other embryonic deformities that are present.&nbsp;Developing embryo is most susceptible to&nbsp;teratogens&nbsp;exposure during its embryonic period&nbsp;which is&nbsp;from 3rd to&nbsp;8th week (first 2 months).This is because the embryonic period is the time when most organ systems are&nbsp;developing;&nbsp;hence teratogen exposure at this point can be&nbsp;disastrous.&nbsp;Teratogens frequently tested by the USMLE are given below:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>ACE Inhibitors: Cause Renal damage</li>\r\n\t<li>Aminoglycosides: Cranial nerve 8, Vestibulocochlear Nerve Abnormalities.</li>\r\n\t<li>Carbamazepine: Facial dysmorphism, developmental delay and neural tube defects.</li>\r\n\t<li>Lithium (used to treat the&nbsp;manic&nbsp;phase of Bipolar disorder): Ebstein Anomaly in which the tricuspid valve leaflets are displaced inferiorly into the right ventricle. It presents with widely split S2 and Tricuspid Regurgitation.</li>\r\n\t<li>Phenytoin: Can cause fetal Hydantoin syndrome i.e., cleft palate, cardiac defects and phalanx or fingernail hypoplasia.</li>\r\n\t<li>Tetracyclines: Discoloration of teeth.</li>\r\n\t<li>Thalidomide: Limb defects.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>ROLE OF RETIONOIC ACID: Increased retinoic acid concentration in an area of blood vessel formation leads to formation of a venous channel. However, a decrease in retinoic acid concentration&nbsp;favours&nbsp;the formation of an arterial channel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN&nbsp;VASCULOGENESIS &amp; ANGIOGENESIS:&nbsp;&nbsp;Vasculogenesis&nbsp;is defined&nbsp;as&nbsp;formation of a new blood vessel literally from nothing or scratch. Angiogenesis on the other&nbsp;hand is defined as, formation of a new blood vessel from an existing vascular channel&nbsp;by branching.

In this lecture&nbsp;and its subsequent review,&nbsp;we&nbsp;discuss the high yield topic of atrial septation&nbsp;and development plus relevant&nbsp;congenital defect which can occur during this&nbsp;process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FUNCTION OF&nbsp;INTERATRIAL&nbsp;SPETUM:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;It divides the primitive atria into a right and left atria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;During&nbsp;fetal&nbsp;life provides it provides a patent right to left shunt and&nbsp;ensures the shunt is not in the opposite direction of left to right shunt.&nbsp;During&nbsp;fetal&nbsp;life right to left shunts are&nbsp;essential for the survival of&nbsp;the&nbsp;fetus. A hallmark of the&nbsp;fetal&nbsp;circulation, which differentiates&nbsp;itfrom the adult circulation,&nbsp;is&nbsp;that&nbsp;the right atriumreceives the oxygenated blood from the placenta via&nbsp;the inferior vena cava.&nbsp;In an adult heart, the right side deals with the deoxygenated blood!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3)&nbsp;After birth, when there&#39;s no need a right&nbsp;to left shunt since the lungs&nbsp;have become functional, foramen&nbsp;ovaletends to close. At this point&nbsp;interatrial septum divides adult left&nbsp;and right atria into separate&nbsp;non-communicating&nbsp;chambers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ATRIAL SPETATION:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially&nbsp;the right and the left atria are actually one single chamber which is referred to Primitive Atrium.&nbsp;Sinus Venosus provides the Inflow in&nbsp;this primitive atrium. The&nbsp;primitiveatrium&nbsp;is divided into two separate&nbsp;left and right atria following the process of&nbsp;atrial&nbsp;septation. Atrial&nbsp;Septation is actually a series of events which involves 2&nbsp;septae&nbsp;(Septum&nbsp;Primum &amp; Septum Secundum) and 2 foraminae (Foramen Primum &amp; Foramen&nbsp;Secundum) forming within the primitive atria, thereby dividing it into a&nbsp;right and left atrium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>STEPS INVOLVED IN ATRIAL SEPTATION:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the roof of the primitive atrium a flexible and&nbsp;crescenteric&nbsp;shaped Septum Primum grows inferiorly towards the&nbsp;endocardial&nbsp;cushions. The initial defect in between the&nbsp;down growing&nbsp;septum&nbsp;primum and the endocardial cushions is&nbsp;referred&nbsp;to as foramen primum. Foramen Primum functions to allow shunting of blood from the right atrium to the left atrium</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;Foramen Primum is eventually obliterated when the inferior edge of the&nbsp;septum primum fuses with the endocardial cushions. Just before the foramen primum closes, multiple small secondary defects form within the upper wall&nbsp;of septum primum as result of apoptosis. These multiple small&nbsp;defects in the upper wall of septum primum coalesce into forming a single defect&nbsp;called the foramen&nbsp;secundum. Foramen secundum is formed before the foramen&nbsp;primum is closed, and it serves to maintain the very important function of&nbsp;reinforcing a right to left shunt of the oxygenated blood entering the right atrium via the inferior vena cava.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;While the septum primum is undergoing these changes, from the roof of the atrium and just to the right of septum&nbsp;primum, a second&nbsp;crescentic&nbsp;shaped septum&nbsp;secundum&nbsp;starts developing. &nbsp;As the septum secundumgrows downwards, it&nbsp;extends and obliterates most of the foramen secundum. The remaining part of&nbsp;foramensecundum which isn&#39;t obliterated by the septum secundum is referred to as Foramen Ovale. The function of foramen ovale is the same as that of the foraminae primum and secundum, which was&nbsp;to maintain a right to left shunt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3)&nbsp;It&#39;s important to remember that septum primum is a rather flexible&nbsp;structure compared to septum secundum which is a relatively rigid structure. This rather flexible property of the septum primum allows its&nbsp;inferior flap (which isn&#39;t covered by the septum secundum) to function as valve for foramen ovale. This valve allows the flow of blood from the right to left side thereby&nbsp;reinforcing&nbsp;the shunt, but it tends to disallow the backflow of the blood from the left atria to the right atria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4)&nbsp;Septum Primum and Septum Secundum eventually fuse to form the interatrial septum. Most of the interatrial septum is formed from two septae (primum and secundum). However, the inferior part of the interatrial septum forms from a single septum (septum primum only), and hence this part&nbsp;is rather thinner compared to the rest of the atrial septae. This thinner part of the interatrial septum in the adult heart is referred to as Fossa Ovalis and is a major anatomical landmark of the adult right atrium. Fossa&nbsp;ovalis presents as a marked&nbsp;crescentic&nbsp;ridge on the medial wall of the right atrium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5)&nbsp;Immediately after birth&nbsp;Foramen&nbsp;Ovale tends to close. After birth there&#39;s an increase in left atrial pressure. The above mentioned decreased right atrial and increased left atrial pressure&nbsp;changes result in closure of the foramen&nbsp;ovale&nbsp;after birth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CLINICAL &amp; PATHOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PROBE PATENCY OF FORAMEN OVALE: A probe is passed from the right atrium into the left atrium to check whether the foramen ovale has closed or not.&nbsp;In cases where the probe can pass through into the left atrium, it means&nbsp;that septum secundum &amp; septum primum&nbsp;have&nbsp;not fused completely together and hence the foramen ovale is still patent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FORAMEN SECUNDUM DEFECT/ SECUNDUM TYPE ASD: This is the most common type of ASD. It occurs due to excessive resorption of the septum&nbsp;primum&nbsp;and septum&nbsp;secundum.&nbsp;It&nbsp;usually presents with delayed clinical symptoms after the age of 30, before the age of 30 it&#39;s usually asymptomatic.&nbsp;Identified after thirty years of age due to Right ventricular hypertrophy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>primum&nbsp;type atrial septal defects result due to a failure of the septum&nbsp;primum&nbsp;to fuse inferiorly with the endocardial cushions</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>​</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;COR TRICLOCULARE BI VENTRICULARE: It&#39;s basically a three chambered heart with one common atrium and two ventricles, thereby highlighting the situation where interatrial septum fails to develop.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;PREMATURE CLOSURE OF THE FORAMEN OVALE:&nbsp;As mentioned earlier that foramen ovale is supposed to remain patent until after birth.&nbsp;If however,foramen ovale closes early due to premature fusion of septae primum &amp; secundum before birth, this can result in a hypertrophied right&nbsp;side of&nbsp;heart&nbsp;plus an&nbsp;underdeveloped&nbsp;left sided chambers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DEVELOPMENT OF RIGHT ATRIUM &amp; THE FATE OF SINUS VENOSUS:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heart tube with its dilatations undergoes an S-shaped bending which results in an orientation where the outflow tract (truncus arteriosus) lies most anteriorly. Behind the truncus arteriosus is the primitive ventricle and&nbsp;still behind is the primitive atrium. On the posterior surface of the primitive atrium opens the sinus venosus along with its&nbsp;branches. Branches of sinus venosus are anterior cardinal vein, posterior cardinal vein and the common cardinal vein. Two vitelline and umbilical veins also drain into sinus venosus. Initially the sinus venosus drains into the middle of the posterior wall of&nbsp;primordial&nbsp;atrium, however due to flow and hemodynamic changes, sinus venosus starts growing towards the right side. Ultimately sinus venosus ends up opening at the posterior right end of the right atrium. Hemodynamic changes responsible for this right side shifting of sinus venosus are as following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;An anastomosis forms between the anterior cardinal veins of either side, and the blood starts flowing from the left to the right side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;Umbilical and vitelline veins on the left side start degenerating. This results in an increased blood flow into the right side as blood from the caudal part of the fetus is also shunted to the right side of the right atrium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3)&nbsp;Eventually the right umbilical vein also&nbsp;degenerates, and the right vitelline vein starts increasing in&nbsp;calibre. Endresult of these hemodynamic changes is that sinus venosus shifts and starts growing on the right side.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the left side the remaining degenerating pieces of the sinus venosus become the coronary sinus. Right&nbsp;vitelline vein in future becomes the inferior vena cava. The common cardinal vein becomes the future&nbsp;superior&nbsp;vena cava. &nbsp;All these changes contribute to an increase in the size of right atrium since sinus&nbsp;venosus=&nbsp;has also shifted there as part of its development. Anterior view of the right atrium shows that it&#39;s divided by the crista terminalis into a smooth and rough or trabeculated part. The trabeculated parts of right atrium and the right auricle are derived from the primitive atria. The smooth parts are derived from the primitive inflow tract which was sinus venosus. Crista terminalis is the landmark where parts of sinus venosus were absorbed into right&nbsp;atrium as&nbsp;parts of right atrial development. The lower part of the sinus venosus marks the valve of the inferior vena cava. Also there is an opening of coronary sinus which actually is the degenerated left sinus venosus draining into the right atrium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DEVELOPMENT OF THE LEFT ATRIUM: Left atrial&nbsp;development&nbsp;is relatively not as complicated. Trabeculated part and the left auricle form a very small component of left atrium and they&#39;re derived from the primitive atrium. Majority of the left atrium is its smooth part which is derived from the primordial pulmonary trunk which&nbsp;gets&nbsp;absorbed as part of left atrial development. Primordial pulmonary trunk is actually a budding off of the left atrium. The primordial pulmonary&nbsp;turn&nbsp;initially grows and forms four branches. However, so much of the primordial pulmonary trunk is&nbsp;absorbed&nbsp;into the making of left atrium that its four branches end up opening&nbsp;directly into&nbsp;the left atrium.</p>\r\n", "locales" : [ { "languageCode" : "en-us", "source" : "23video", "referenceId" : "13434067", "referenceToken" : "2fea8493051cc73f0aee834d8c9c7789", "referenceLocationId" : "12732915", "authToken" : "e252d9c650ba334b0319e5452d7e9d78" } ], "tags" : { "section" : "Embryology", "topic" : [ "embryology", "", "Embryology", "CVS Embryology" ], "info" : [ "foundational", "usmleStep1", "cme" ], "subject" : "Embryology", "system" : "Cardiovascular System", "concentrations" : [  ], "keywords" : [  ], "practice" : [  ] }, "packages" : [ "prohealth", "drbeen-yearly-discount", "drbeen-yearly", "unlimited-cme", "unlimited-cme-intro", "unlimited-cme-uaprn", "uaprn-conference", "student-monthly", "student-yearly", "student-coffee-2016", "student-beans-2016", "np-sprout-2016", "stgeorge-sprout-2016", "professional-monthly", "professional-yearly", "drbeen-monthly", "limited-student-lifetime", "lifetime-plan", "lifetime-access-special", "lifetime-access-half-price", "lifetime-access-discount", "lifetime-access-promo", "lifetime-access", "lifetime-access-49", "drnajeeb-special", "drnajeeb-cme", "stgeorge-coffee-2016", "np-coffee-2016", "stgeorge-bean-2016", "np-beans-2016", "al-ahli-hospital-pilot", "aanp-special-drnajeeb", "aanp-2017-yearly-access", "aanp-2017-lifetime-access", "monthly", "yearly", "drbeen-electives", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "usmle-step-1", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-79", "drbeen-yearly-49", "lifetime-access-1", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-67", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "lifetime-access-27", "drbeen-quarterly", "lifetime-discounted-50", "db-a-lifetime", "drbeen-uaprn", "db-uaprn-2018", "sellular-access", "special-been", "nc-been", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-49", "free-trial-account", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "free-trial-h", "student-monthly-22", "student-lifetime-access", "promotional-been", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-25", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "monthly", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "drbeen-gift", "lifetime-access-67", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "yearly-special", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "summer-discount", "summer-discount" ], "status" : "enabled", "slug" : "atrial-development", "seq" : 4, "updatedAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-12T16:59:25.276+0000" }, "instructors" : [ { "orderNum" : 1, "user" : { "$oid" : "57c6515c1a4f528e46bc4708" }, "role" : "lead" } ], "shortId" : "SkZzlsGAd2l-", "access" : "subscription", "datePublished" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:37.000+0000" }, "createdAt" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:37.000+0000" }, "keywords" : [  ], "learningObjectives" : [  ], "ratings" : [  ], "__v" : 1 },

Right atrium and sinus venosus Right atrium and pulmonary veins Fate of sinus venosus Development of the left atrium Smooth vs pectinate parts of the atria", "longDescription" : "<p>Atrial &amp; Ventricular septum formation process begins at the same time by the start of the 4th week and wraps up by the 8th week. Though occurring simultaneously, however, atrial septation is a little ahead of ventricular septation. Common congenital cardiac anomalies mostly occur due to defects in the formation of these septae. In this lecture and its subsequent review, we discuss the high yield topic of atrial septation and development plus relevant congenital defect which can occur during this process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FUNCTION OF INTERATRIAL SPETUM:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>It divides the primitive atria into a right and left atria.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>During fetal life provides it provides a patent right to left shunt and ensures the shunt is not in the opposite direction of left to right shunt. During fetal life right to left shunts are essential for the survival of the fetus. A hallmark of the fetal circulation, which differentiates it from the adult circulation, is that the right atrium receives the oxygenated blood from the placenta via the inferior vena cava. In an adult heart, the right side deals with the deoxygenated blood!</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>After birth, when there&#39;s no need a right to left shunt since the lungs have become functional, foramen ovale tends to close. At this point interatrial septum divides adult left and right atria into separate non-communicating chambers.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>ATRIAL SEPTATION:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Embryonic timeline of Atrial Septation: &nbsp;Late 4th week to the middle of the 6th week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially the right and the left atria are actually one single chamber which is referred to Primitive Atrium. Sinus Venosus provides the Inflow in this primitive atrium. The primitive atrium is divided into two separate left and right atria following the process of atrial septation. Atrial Septation is actually a series of events which involves 2 septae (Septum Primum &amp; Septum Secundum) and 2 foraminae (Foramen Primum &amp; Foramen Secundum) forming within the primitive atria, thereby dividing it into a right and left atrium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>STEPS INVOLVED IN ATRIAL SEPTATION:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>From the roof of the primitive atrium a flexible and crescenteric shaped Septum Primum grows inferiorly towards the endocardial cushions. The initial defect in between the down growing septum primum and the endocardial cushions is referred to as foramen primum. Foramen Primum functions to allow shunting of blood from the right atrium to the left atrium. Endocardial cushion itself is a derivative of neural crest cells and gives rise to the following structures in a adult heart:</p>\r\n\r\n\t<ol>\r\n\t\t<li>Atrioventricular Valves</li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p>Membranous part of Interventricular septum</p>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p>Aorticopulmonary septum</p>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p>Left &amp; Right Atrioventricular canals</p>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t</ol>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Foramen Primum is eventually obliterated when the inferior edge of the septum primum fuses with the endocardial cushions. Just before the foramen primum closes, multiple small secondary defects form within the upper wall of septum primum as result of apoptosis. These multiple small defects in the upper wall of septum primum coalesce into forming a single defect called the foramen secundum. Foramen secundum is formed before the foramen primum is closed, and it serves to maintain the very important function of reinforcing a right to left shunt of the oxygenated blood entering the right atrium via the inferior vena cava.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>While the septum primum is undergoing these changes, from the roof of the atrium and just to the right of septum primum, a second crescentic shaped septum secundum starts developing. &nbsp;As the septum secundum grows downwards, it extends and obliterates most of the foramen secundum. The remaining part of foramen secundum which isn&#39;t obliterated by the septum secundum is referred to as Foramen Ovale. The function of foramen ovale is the same as that of the foraminae primum and secundum, which was to maintain a right to left shunt.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>It&#39;s important to remember that septum primum is a rather flexible structure compared to septum secundum which is a relatively rigid structure. This rather flexible property of the septum primum allows its inferior flap (which isn&#39;t covered by the septum secundum) to function as valve for foramen ovale. This valve allows the flow of blood from the right to left side thereby reinforcing the shunt, but it tends to disallow the backflow of the blood from the left atria to the right atria.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Septum Primum and Septum Secundum eventually fuse to form the interatrial septum. Most of the interatrial septum is formed from two septae (primum and secundum). However, the inferior part of the interatrial septum forms from a single septum (septum primum only), and hence this part is rather thinner compared to the rest of the atrial septae. This thinner part of the interatrial septum in the adult heart is referred to as Fossa Ovalis and is a major anatomical landmark of the adult right atrium. Fossa ovalis presents as a marked crescentic ridge on the medial wall of the right atrium.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Immediately after birth Foramen Ovale tends to close. After birth there&#39;s an increase in left atrial pressure due to decreased pulmonary vascular resistance which enhances pulmonary blood flow and subsequent return of blood to the left side of the heart. Also, closure of the umbilical veins tends to decrease the right atrial pressure with respect to left atrial pressure. The above mentioned decreased right atrial and increased left atrial pressure changes result in closure of the foramen ovale after birth.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>CLINICAL &amp; PATHOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>PROBE PATENCY OF FORAMEN OVALE: A probe is passed from the right atrium into the left atrium to check whether the foramen ovale has closed or not. In cases where the probe can pass through into the left atrium, it means that septum secundum &amp; septum primum have not fused completely together and hence the foramen ovale is still patent. Patent foramen ovale is present in 25% of normal adults without any symptoms. Even if it&#39;s patent, the foramen ovale remains functionally closed due to post birth increased left atrial pressure. However, transient increase in right atrial pressure above the left atrial pressure (such as during Valsalva manoeuvre) can lead to a right to left shunt via the patent foramen ovale. This can lead to paradoxical emboli, where venous thromboemboli cross into the systemic arterial circulation and can cause various clinical complications.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>FORAMEN SECUNDUM DEFECT/ SECUNDUM TYPE ASD: This is the most common type of ASD, which usually presents with delayed clinical symptoms after the age of 30, before the age of 30 it&#39;s usually asymptomatic. Secundum type ASD presents with variable sized defects in between the right and left atria. These defects are present in the central part of the interatrial septum, just above the limbus. Secundum type defects may occur due to one of the &nbsp;following, or both:</p>\r\n\r\n\t<ol>\r\n\t\t<li>Excessive resorption of the Septum Primum can result in a very large Foramen Secundum being formed which couldn&#39;t be effectively closed by the Septum Secundum.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Alternatively Secundum type defects can occur when there&#39;s an underdeveloped septum secundum which has a relatively smaller size and hence cannot efficiently obliterate the foramen ovale.</li>\r\n\t</ol>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides Secundum type defects, although much less common but there are also Primum type atrial septal defects. These primum type atrial septal defects result due to a failure of the septum primum to fuse inferiorly with the endocardial cushions. These Primum type defects can be located in the lower aspect of interatrial septum. Fossa ovalis tends to normal in primum type defects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinical signs of atrial septal defects include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Wide, fixed splitting of S2.</li>\r\n\t<li>Systolic ejection murmur best audible in the 2nd intercostals space along the left sternal border.</li>\r\n\t<li>Atrial septal defects can also lead to paradoxical emboli similar to those in case of patent foramen ovale.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>COR TRICLOCULARE BI VENTRICULARE: It&#39;s basically a three chambered heart with one common atrium and two ventricles, thereby highlighting the situation where interatrial septum fails to develop.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>PREMATURE CLOSURE OF THE FORAMEN OVALE: As mentioned earlier that foramen ovale is supposed to remain patent until after birth. If however, foramen ovale closes early due to premature fusion of septae primum &amp; secundum before birth, this can result in a hypertrophied right and left ventricles plus an underdeveloped left sided chambers.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>DEVELOPMENT OF RIGHT ATRIUM &amp; THE FATE OF SINUS VENOSUS:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heart tube with its dilatations undergoes an S-shaped bending which results in an orientation where the outflow tract (truncus arteriosus) lies most anteriorly. Behind the truncus arteriosus is the primitive ventricle and still behind is the primitive atrium. On the posterior surface of the primitive atrium opens the sinus venosus along with its branches. Branches of sinus venosus are anterior cardinal vein, posterior cardinal vein and the common cardinal vein. Two vitelline and umbilical veins also drain into sinus venosus. Initially the sinus venosus drains into the middle of the posterior wall of right atrium, however due to flow and hemodynamic changes, sinus venosus starts growing towards the right side. Ultimately sinus venosus ends up opening at the posterior right end of the right atrium. Hemodynamic changes responsible for this right side shifting of sinus venosus are as following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>An anastomosis forms between the anterior cardinal veins of either side, and the blood starts flowing from the left to the right side.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Umbilical and vitelline veins on the left side start degenerating. This results in an increased blood flow into the right side as blood from the caudal part of the fetus is also shunted to the right side of the right atrium.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Eventually the right umbilical vein also degenerates, and the right vitelline vein starts increasing in calibre. End result of these hemodynamic changes is that sinus venosus shifts and starts growing on the right side.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>On the left side the remaining degenerating pieces of the sinus venosus become the coronary sinus. Right vitelline vein in future becomes the inferior vena cava. The common cardinal vein becomes the future superior vena cava. &nbsp;All these changes contribute to an increase in the size of right atrium since sinus venosus has also shifted there as part of its development. Anterior view of the right atrium shows that it&#39;s divided by the crista terminalis into a smooth and rough or trabeculated part. The trabeculated parts of right atrium and the right auricle are derived from the primitive atria. The smooth parts are derived from the primitive inflow tract which was sinus venosus. Crista terminalis is the landmark where parts of sinus venosus were absorbed into right atrium as parts of right atrial development. The lower part of the sinus venosus marks the valve of the inferior vena cava. Also there is an opening of coronary sinus which actually is the degenerated left sinus venosus draining into the right atrium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DEVELOPMENT OF THE LEFT ATRIUM: Left atrial development is relatively not as complicated.

Before the sinus venosus gets incorporated into the right atrium and forms the conducting system of the heart, the primitive atrium serves as the function of the pacemaker.Atrial&nbsp;myocytes around the sinus venosus develop a faster intrinsic rhythm thereby naturally taking over as the pacemaker cells.&nbsp;These myocytes are derived from mesoderm.This means that as the myocardial cells are developing to form atria, they develop this ability to depolarize spontaneously. This allows the primitive heart to start beating by the 22nd day and that too without a true pacemaker, hence the primitive atria starts depolarizing even before the pacemaker is formed. Since sinus venosus is at the caudal end of the heart tube and serves as the inflow region. The initial pulsations are in coherence with the direction of the blood flow i.e., from caudal to the cranial side of the developing heart tube. &nbsp;Eventually as the sinus venosus is incorporated into the right atrium, the SA node develops from the sinus venosus near the entry of the superior vena cava.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AV node also develops from the&nbsp;sinus venosus&nbsp;near the opening of the coronary sinus. As the AV node develops, bundle of HIS also develops along with it from the sinus venosus. The bundle of HIS develops within the interventricular septum and divides into right and left bundle branches. The cells around the AV node which become consolidated into forming the Bundle of HIS exhibit the MSX-2 homeobox gene. Purkinje fibers are actually modified contractile myocytes which start to function as conducting fibers when they become connected with Bundle of HIS cells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important structure is the fibrous septum which insulates the ventricles from the depolarization of the atria and vice versa. This fibrous skeleton of the heart develops from the epicardium which is the visceral pericardium of the heart. The cells of the epicardium are derived from the local mesodermal cells around the sinus venosus as well.</p>\r\n", "locales" : [ { "languageCode" : "en-us", "source" : "23video", "referenceId" : "13434069", "referenceToken" : "6bf0752cca3ccdeb5a0484df1b216eee", "referenceLocationId" : "12732917", "authToken" : "7cbda482582b0f2ce9935159aafcbbfd" } ], "tags" : { "section" : "Embryology", "topic" : [ "embryology", "", "Embryology", "The Basics", "EKG Basics", "CVS Embryology" ], "info" : [ "foundational", "usmleStep1", "cme", "cme" ], "subject" : "Embryology", "system" : "Cardiovascular System", "concentrations" : [  ], "keywords" : [  ], "practice" : [  ] }, "packages" : [ "prohealth", "drbeen-yearly-discount", "drbeen-yearly", "yearly", "unlimited-cme", "unlimited-cme-intro", "unlimited-cme-uaprn", "uaprn-conference", "student-monthly", "student-yearly", "student-coffee-2016", "student-beans-2016", "stgeorge-sprout-2016", "np-sprout-2016", "professional-monthly", "professional-yearly", "drbeen-monthly", "monthly", "limited-student-lifetime", "lifetime-plan", "lifetime-coffee-2016", "lifetime-access-special", "lifetime-access-half-price", "lifetime-access-discount", "lifetime-access-promo", "lifetime-access", "lifetime-access-49", "ekg-interpretation-course", "drnajeeb-special", "drnajeeb-cme", "stgeorge-coffee-2016", "np-coffee-2016", "stgeorge-bean-2016", "np-beans-2016", "al-ahli-hospital-pilot", "aanp-special-drnajeeb", "aanp-2017-yearly-access", "aanp-2017-lifetime-access", "drbeen-electives", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "usmle-step-1", "usmle-step-1", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-79", "drbeen-yearly-49", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-67", "lifetime-access-67", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "lifetime-access-27", "drbeen-quarterly", "lifetime-discounted-50", "db-a-lifetime", "drbeen-uaprn", "db-uaprn-2018", "sellular-access", "special-been", "nc-been", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-49", "lifetime-access-49", "free-trial-account", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "free-trial-h", "student-monthly-22", "student-lifetime-access", "promotional-been", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-25", "lifetime-access-25", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "free-trial-account", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "monthly", "monthly", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "drbeen-gift", "drbeen-gift", "lifetime-access-67", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "yearly-special", "yearly-special", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "summer-discount", "summer-discount", "summer-discount" ], "status" : "enabled", "slug" : "development-of-the-conduction-system-of-the-heart", "seq" : 3, "updatedAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-12T16:59:25.276+0000" }, "instructors" : [ { "orderNum" : 1, "user" : { "$oid" : "57c6515c1a4f528e46bc4708" }, "role" : "lead" } ], "shortId" : "SkQGxiGROhlb", "access" : "subscription", "datePublished" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:37.000+0000" }, "createdAt" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:37.000+0000" }, "keywords" : [  ], "learningObjectives" : [  ], "ratings" : [  ], "__v" : 2 },

Aorta forms an arch before descending&nbsp;downwards&nbsp;as the thoracic/descending aorta. This arch of aorta gives rise to three arteries; from right to left these arteries are the, left common carotid and the left subclavian artery. On the right side the brachiocephalic trunk gives rise to right subclavian artery and then continues as the right common carotid artery which eventually divides into internal and external carotid arteries of the right side. The left common carotid artery is a direct branch of arch of aorta and it ends up&nbsp;dividing&nbsp;into external carotid and internal carotid arteries of the left side. Finally the left subclavian artery arises from the arch of aorta prior to the ductus arteriosus, after which the arch curves&nbsp;downwards&nbsp;and continues as descending or thoracic aorta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the embryo is developing, two dorsal aortae develop on either side and give off branches to oxygenate ventral and dorsal parts of the embryo. Simultaneously the pharyngeal arches develop along with their pharyngeal arteries. There are six pharyngeal arteries that develop. The first&nbsp;two&nbsp;pairs&nbsp;of pharyngeal arteries develops by the 3rd and 4th week and the sixth pair develops by the 6th or 7th week. By the time the last pair (6th pair) of the pharyngeal arteries develops, the first and second pair of pharyngeal arteries has degenerated. It&#39;s important to remember that all six pairs of pharyngeal arch arteries aren&#39;t&nbsp;present at the same time. The&nbsp;1st and 2nd pharyngeal arch arteries give rise to part of Maxillary artery and Stapedial artery respectively. Other than that the first two pharyngeal arch arteries degenerate. The 3rd pharyngeal arch artery is of importance, as it combines with the adjacent part of dorsal aorta to form common carotid and proximal part of the internal carotid arteries. The 4th pharyngeal arch artery on the right side gives rise to&nbsp;Brachiocephalic trunk&nbsp;part before the origin of common carotid artery&nbsp;while the left side it gives rise to the aortic arch. The 5th pharyngeal arch artery normally&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;develop in humans. However, in cases where it does develop, it tends to be rudimentary and degenerates soon.5th&nbsp;pharyngeal arch artery regresses and degenerates.&nbsp;The 6th pharyngeal arch artery gives rise to ductus arteriosus on the left side and it regresses on the right side.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the right side, the 1st, 2nd, 5th and 6th pharyngeal arch&nbsp;arteries&nbsp;tend to regress (completely or partially) whereas, the 3rd and 4th are of importance in terms of giving rise to adult structures. On the left side 1st, 2nd and 5th pharyngeal arch arteries tend to regress (completely or partially), whereas the 3rd, 4th and 6th give rise to arterial structures.

The parts of dorsal aortae connected to the 4th, 5th&nbsp;and 6th pharyngeal arches tend to degenerate as well. As a result the 3rd pharyngeal arch arteries on either side get directly&nbsp;connectedin the middle to the aortic sac. Inferiorly,&nbsp;the aortic sac is connected to the truncus arteriosus which at this point is undergoing septation to form&nbsp;aorta and the pulmonary trunk. &nbsp;So, the initial part of the pulmonary trunk is formed by the truncus arteriosus whereas the point where the pulmonary trunk bifurcates into two pulmonary arteries (proximal parts of pulmonary arteries) is formed by the 6th pharyngeal arch artery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, the 3rd pharyngeal arch (which is directly connected to the aortic sac) starts dividing along with the aortic sac. This division eventually&nbsp;results in the brachiocephalic trunk developing on the right side. On the&nbsp;left side, part of the 3rd&nbsp;pharyngeal arch forms the&nbsp;aortic arch. Common carotid and&nbsp;part of&nbsp;internal carotid arteries on both sides&nbsp;are formed by the 3rd pharyngeal arch artery as well. However, distal part of internal carotid is formed by the dorsal aorta.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fate of dorsal aorta is different on either side. On the right side, the dorsal aorta ends up forming the right subclavian artery. On the left side&nbsp;however,&nbsp;the dorsal aorta forms a part of the descending aorta and the arch of aorta. Aorta primarily forms from the aortic sac. Although,&nbsp;part of aorta that is proximal to the commencement of the common carotid artery on the left side, is formed by the artery of the 4th pharyngeal arch. On the right side as well, the part just before the commencement of the common carotid artery from&nbsp;the brachiocephalic trunk is formed by the 4th pharyngeal arch artery. Right Subclavian artery forms from the dorsal aorta, whereas the left subclavian artery forms from existing vasculature as part of angiogenesis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the right side, the right vagus nerve gives rise to right recurrent laryngeal nerve which passes under the&nbsp;right subclavian artery to ascend towards the larynx region. On the left side, the left&nbsp;vagus nerve gives rise to left recurrent laryngeal nerve which hooks around the ligamentum arteriosum and further curves under the aortic arch to ascend and reach the larynx. On the right side, part of the 6th pharyngeal artery tends to degenerate hence the right recurrent laryngeal nerve has to pass behind the right subclavian artery on, as it courses upward.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An important clinical correlate to remember is that, as the left recurrent laryngeal nerve curves under the arch of aorta, it can get damaged by aortic arch aneurysm or a malignancy. Left recurrent laryngeal nerve damage can result in paralysis of the left vocal cords. On the right side, since right recurrent laryngeal is unaffected by any aortic arch pathologies because it arises from the right vagus nerve in the root of the neck and subsequently passes under the subclavian artery (and not under the arch of aorta).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ligamentum arteriosum is the embryologic&nbsp;remnant&nbsp;of the ductus arteriosus. Ductus arteriosus itself arises from the left 6th pharyngeal arch artery. Ductus arteriosus opens into underside of the arch of aorta (distal to origin of the left subclavian artery) and it functions to form a shunt which allows the flow of deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary trunk to the aorta (right to left shunt). This right to left shunting allows the deoxygenated blood to complete bypass the pulmonary circuit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COARCTATION OF AORTA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coarctation of aorta is a constriction of the aorta just after it has given rise to subclavian artery.&nbsp;Post the coarctation site, the aorta becomes significantly narrowed and the blood supply to the lower limb and the abdomen is diminished which results in weak&nbsp;pulses of the lower limb. As compensation, over time collaterals develop around the chest wall and the abdomen to supply the lower body. Coarctation of aorta also affects the heart, which now has to pump against greater peripheral resistance and hence at a higher pressure in order to maintain peripheral circulation, thus it may lead to cardiac failure in severe cases.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s important to understand the underlying cause for this coarctation of aorta.&nbsp;During development, the ductus arteriosus is composed of a specialized smooth muscular contractile tissue. This specialized contractile tissue at times makes its way into the arch of aorta. Hence, after birth when this migrated contractile tissue&nbsp;contracts&nbsp;and tends to narrow the aortic lumen (similar to obliteration of ductus arteriosus in response to increased oxygen and decreased PGE levels), there&#39;s a resultant coarctation of the aorta. Alternatively,developmental alteration&nbsp;can also result in the coarctation of aorta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinically, coarctation of aorta manifests with the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Brachial-femoral pulse delay.</li>\r\n\t<li>Blood pressure discrepancies between upper and lower extremities. These discrepancies normally present as hypertension in the upper extremities but feeble and delayed pulses in the lower limb.</li>\r\n\t<li>Associated with bicuspid aortic valve.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Coarctation of aorta is divided into two types based on the location of the narrowing of aorta with respect to the position of ductus arteriosus:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>PREDUCTAL COARCTATION&nbsp;is also referred to as the infantile type, and&nbsp;it occurs prior to the site of ductus arteriosus. In this case the ductus arteriosus tends to remain patent. As part of compensation,&nbsp;the patent ductus arteriosus provides blood to the descending aorta and hence the lower parts of the body. Prostaglandin E analogues tend to keep the ductus arteriosus patent and they are administered to newborns in cases where DA patency is required.&nbsp;An important high yield point to remember is that preductal coarctation has a strong association with Turner&#39;s&nbsp;syndrome.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>POSTDUCTAL COARCTATION&nbsp;is the more common type and tends to occur in the adults. The narrowing of aorta in this case is distal to the origin of ductus arteriosus and hence DA tends to obliterate according to its normal timeline (immediately after birth). The compensatory collateral circulation&nbsp;in utero&nbsp;in this case is provided by the&nbsp;by the collaterals which develop between the left subclavian, internal thoracic and intercostals to supply blood to lower part of body.&nbsp;Over time, the collateral intercostal arteries enlarge resulting in erosion of the lower border of ribs which presents as notched appearance of ribs on the chest x-ray. This notched appearance of ribs on CXR is referred to as costal notching.</li>\r\n\t<li>In Patent Ductus Arteriosus antiprostaglandins&nbsp;i.e.NSAIDS like Indomethacin and Ibuprofen are given.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n", "locales" : [ { "languageCode" : "en-us", "source" : "23video", "referenceId" : "13434062", "referenceToken" : "62f3c25fb2601a1775eb1fd441ad6e2a", "referenceLocationId" : "12732917", "authToken" : "0276e42bf154527b3629f297002689cc" } ], "tags" : { "section" : "Embryology", "topic" : [ "embryology", "", "Embryology", "CVS Embryology" ], "info" : [ "foundational", "usmleStep1", "cme" ], "subject" : "Embryology", "system" : "Cardiovascular System", "concentrations" : [  ], "keywords" : [  ], "practice" : [  ] }, "packages" : [ "prohealth", "drbeen-yearly-discount", "drbeen-yearly", "yearly", "unlimited-cme", "unlimited-cme-intro", "unlimited-cme-uaprn", "uaprn-conference", "student-monthly", "student-yearly", "student-coffee-2016", "student-beans-2016", "stgeorge-sprout-2016", "np-sprout-2016", "professional-monthly", "professional-yearly", "drbeen-monthly", "monthly", "limited-student-lifetime", "lifetime-plan", "lifetime-access-special", "lifetime-access-half-price", "lifetime-access-discount", "lifetime-access-promo", "lifetime-access", "lifetime-access-49", "drnajeeb-special", "drnajeeb-cme", "stgeorge-coffee-2016", "np-coffee-2016", "stgeorge-bean-2016", "np-beans-2016", "al-ahli-hospital-pilot", "aanp-special-drnajeeb", "aanp-2017-yearly-access", "aanp-2017-lifetime-access", "drbeen-electives", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "usmle-step-1", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-79", "drbeen-yearly-49", "lifetime-access-1", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-67", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "lifetime-access-27", "drbeen-quarterly", "lifetime-discounted-50", "db-a-lifetime", "drbeen-uaprn", "db-uaprn-2018", "sellular-access", "special-been", "nc-been", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-49", "free-trial-account", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "free-trial-h", "student-monthly-22", "student-lifetime-access", "promotional-been", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-25", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "monthly", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "drbeen-gift", "lifetime-access-67", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "yearly-special", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "summer-discount", "summer-discount" ], "status" : "enabled", "slug" : "pharyngeal-arch-arteries", "seq" : 6, "updatedAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-12T16:59:25.277+0000" }, "instructors" : [ { "orderNum" : 1, "user" : { "$oid" : "57c6515c1a4f528e46bc4708" }, "role" : "lead" } ], "shortId" : "SJVMloMRdhlW", "access" : "subscription", "datePublished" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:37.000+0000" }, "createdAt" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:37.000+0000" }, "keywords" : [  ], "learningObjectives" : [  ], "ratings" : [  ], "__v" : 1 },

Then there&#39;s also a single aorticopulmonary trunk opening into primitive ventricles which forms the outflow tract. At this point aorticopulmonary trunk is formed of bulbus cordis and truncus arteriosus and it provides the outflow tract for the primitive ventricles. During later parts of the development the bulbus cordis gets incorporated into the right and left ventricles. Upon incorporation, on the right side the bulbus cordis forms the infundibulum of the right&nbsp;ventricle, and on the left side it forms the vestibule of the left ventricle. Hence, bulbus cordis forms the smooth outflow tracts of the ventricles on either side. Truncus arteriosus on the other hand develops into forming aorta and the pulmonary trunk on the left and the right sides respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adult IV septum consists of two parts, a muscular part (derived from the myocardial cells) which forms the majority of the septum, and a relatively thin membranous part which forms the superior aspect of the IV septum which is part of the outflow tract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the early 5th week, the&nbsp;muscular IV septum&nbsp;develops as an IV septal ridge from the floor of the primitive ventricle near the apex of the heart. This interventricular septal ridge ascends towards the atrioventricular canal, and thereby partially divides the primitive ventricle into left and right ventricles. The IV septal ridge extends towards the atrioventricular canal but it does not reach it, hence giving rise to a gap or defect which is referred to as interventricular foramen (IV Foramen). Thus the IV foramen is formed by the concave upper edge of the IV septum which gives rise to a gap through which shunting&nbsp;of blood between the right and left ventricles occurs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;membranous IV septum&nbsp;descends downward from the AV canal and fuses with the muscular IV septum thereby completely obliterating the IV foramen. The membranous part of IV septum is contributed by the&nbsp;following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Endocardial cushions (Neural crest cells derivative)</li>\r\n\t<li>Aorticopulmonary trunk septum (neural crest cell derivative)</li>\r\n\t<li>Muscular IV septum (Myocardial cells derivative)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>CLINICAL DISORDERS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERVENTRICULAR SEPTUM DEVELOPMENT</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>COR TRILOCULARE BIATRIUM: It&#39;s a three chambered heart with a single/common primitive ventricle and two atria. It occurs due to failure of development of the interventricular septum.</li>\r\n\t<li>MUSCULAR IV SEPTAL DEFECTS: During its development the muscular IV septum can present with defects or holes allowing left to right shunts. Severity of these defects depends upon the size of these gaps. The resultant shunting caused by these defects can lead to right ventricular hypertrophy.</li>\r\n\t<li>MEMBRANOUS IV SEPTAL DEFECTS: This is the most common of the IV septal defects. Part of the membranous IV septum is derived from the endocardial cushions which themselves are neural crest cells derivatives. Neural crest cells are also involved in the craniofacial development, therefore, abnormal migration of neural crest cells will result in concurrent facial and cardiac defects (mostly septal defects &amp; atrioventricular valve problems). As mentioned earlier that it&#39;s the membranous IV septum which is responsible for filling the gap formed by the IV foramen. If there is any defect in the formation of the membranous part of IV septum, the IV foramen will remain patent and left to right shunting of blood will occur. The severity of the left to right shunting due to IV septal defects depends upon the size of the defect. &nbsp;Clinically IV septal defects manifest themselves as following:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Excessive fatigability upon exertion.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>A harsh holosystolic murmur, best audible at the left lower sternal border.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>EISENMENGER COMPLEX: Initially the left to&nbsp;right shunting of the blood via the VSD is noncyanotic because it&rsquo;s the oxygenated left ventricular blood mixing with the deoxygenated right ventricular blood. However, if this left to right shunt is left uncorrected, the increased blood flow into the right side of the heart can lead to pulmonary hypertension due to increased blood flow to the lungs. With time, this pulmonary hypertension can cause pathologic&nbsp;remodeling&nbsp;of pulmonary vasculature. This&nbsp;remodeling&nbsp;involves marked proliferation of tunica intima &amp; media of the muscular pulmonary arteries and arterioles. Ultimately, pulmonary vascular resistance and the compensatory right ventricular hypertrophy together reverse the initial direction of the shunt from &quot;left to right&quot; to &quot;right to left&quot;. After birth, a right to left shunt is cyanotic, because the blood via the shunt is bypassing pulmonary gaseous exchange process and hence remains deoxygenated. Eisenmenger complex presents with late cyanosis,&nbsp;clubbing and polycythemia.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Other&nbsp;than&nbsp;with ventricular&nbsp;septal defects, Eisenmenger complex can also present along with atrial septal defects and patent ductus arteriosus. It&#39;s important to remember that post birth, right to left shunts result in early cyanosis. Whereas, &quot;left to right&quot; shunts result in late cyanosis. Children suffering from late cyanosis are referred to as blue kids in contrast to the newborns which present with cyanosis at birth and are referred to as blue babies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DEVELOPMENT OF AORTICOPULMONATY SEPTUM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aorticopulmonary trunk arises from the&nbsp;primitive&nbsp;ventricles and serves as an outflow tract for the primitive ventricle. An aorticopulmonary septum forms within the aorticopulmonary trunk, thereby subsequently dividing it into the aorta &amp; pulmonary trunk. Aorticopulmonary septum is formed by the&nbsp;migration of neural crest cells into the c&nbsp;conotruncal&nbsp;<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>and bulbar ridges of the truncus arteriosus. These neural crest cells grow in a spiral fashion and fuse to form aorticopulmonary septum. As the aorticopulmonary septum descends as part of its growth, it&nbsp;spirals in such a fashion that aorta becomes the left ventricular outflow tract and the pulmonary trunk becomes the right ventricular outflow tract. As mentioned earlier, as part of its descent the aorticopulmonary septum contributes to the development of&nbsp;the membranous part of interventricular septum and therefore helps fill in the opening formed by the interventricular foramen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DEFECTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AORTICOPULMONARY SEPTUM&nbsp;result due to defects in migration of neural crest cells into the truncus arteriosus. At birth these aorticopulmonary septal defects always present with some cyanosis due to right to left shunting of the blood. Following are the congenital abnormalities associated with development of AP septum:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>PERSISTENT TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS&nbsp;occurs when there&#39;s complete failure of the development of the AP septum due to abnormal migration of neural crest cells. As a result the separation of left ventricular and right ventricular outflow tracts never occurs. Therefore, the aorta and pulmonary trunk&nbsp;form a single outflow vessel (persistent truncus arteriosus) which receives blood from both the right and left ventricles. The common outflow tract allows mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, resulting in cyanosis of varying degree. Even though thetwo outflow tracts separate downstream, but by that time the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood has already occurred, hence it&#39;s a cyanotic defect.&nbsp;Persistent truncus arteriosus is always accompanied by a membranous VSD (AP septum contributes to&nbsp;the formation of membranous part of IV septum, only muscular IV septum forms)and therefore this further allows right to left shunting of the blood.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>TRANSPOSITION OF GREAT ARTERIES&nbsp;occurs when there&#39;s a failure of the AP septum to develop in a spiral fashion secondary to a defective migration of the neural crest cells. This results in a transposition of the outflow tracts, as a result of which, the left ventricle is connected to the&nbsp;pulmonary trunk and the right ventricle is connected to the aorta. Consequently, two completely closed non-communicating circuits are formed which involve the systemic and pulmonary circulations. The systemic circuit forms a closed loop carrying completely deoxygenated blood involving the right side of the heart and the aorta. The pulmonary circuit forms another closed loop carrying oxygenated blood, and involves the left side of the heart and the pulmonary trunk. As expected, transposition and resultant complete separation of pulmonary and systemic circulations lead to a situation which is incompatible with life in the absence of an accompanying shunt or mixing defects. Therefore, infants born alive with this defect tend to have other defects as well, which allow shunting and therefore mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated bloods in between two otherwise closed circuits. As a result, for these newborns, accompanying shunting disorders (ASD, VSD, PDA, PFO)* are rather protective. Absence of a mixing defect requires an atrial septoplasty surgery to create a shunt so that mixing of could occur and thereby sustain life. Transposition of outflow tracts is the most common cause of severe cyanosis, which occurs and persists immediately after birth. Without any surgical intervention or maintenance of PDA (Prostaglandin E analogue administration), most infants don&#39;t survive past the first few months. It&#39;s important to remember that upon imaging, in case of great vessels transposition, the echocardiogram shows an aorta&nbsp;which lies anteriorly and to the right of the pulmonary artery.</li>\r\n\t<li>TETRALOGY OF FALLOT (ToF)&nbsp;is the most common of cyanotic congenital heart defect. This is caused by a misalignment of the aorticopulmonary septum, where it fails to divide the aorticopulmonary trunk in the midline. In case of ToF the AP septum is displaced anteriorly and towards the right or pulmonary side. This results in forming two unequal sized outflow vessels, with a very stenosed pulmonary artery and larger than normal aorta. As the name suggests,&nbsp;Tetralogy of Fallot has 4 component defects which coexist simultaneously. These 4 defects which as following &nbsp;(best remembered with mnemonic PROVe):\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Pulmonary Stenosis: it&#39;s a direct manifestation of the defective rightward misalignment of the&nbsp;AP septum.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Overriding/Straddling Aorta: larger than normal calibre aorta which receives blood from both the left and right ventricles.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Ventricular Septal defect: failure of AP septum to form the membranous part of the IV septum and subsequently fuse with the muscular IV septum, hence the IV foramen isn&#39;t closed which gives rise to a VSD.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Right Ventricular Hypertrophy: develops secondary to pulmonary stenosis, because right ventricle has to pump against a greater resistance of a stenosed outflow tract thereby resulting in compensatory hypertrophy of the right ventricle.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to the presence of a ventricular septal defect, and a stenosed pulmonary outflow tract which presents with greater resistance to blood flow, there&#39;s a right to left shunting of the blood. This right to left shunting results in cyanosis because the blood leaving the heart via the aorta is mixed with deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle.&nbsp;A very important point to remember and which is highly tested as well is that, squatting tends to improve this cyanosis. This is because squatting tends to increase systemic vascular resistance or afterload, which tends to decrease right to left shunting of the blood via the VSD and thereby helps improve the cyanosis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinically, ToF presents with a harsh systolic ejection murmur which can be auscultated at middle to left sternal border. This murmur occurs due to presence of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>KEY:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASD= Atrial septal defect</p>\r\n\r\n<p>VSD= Ventricular septal defect</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PDA= Patent ductus arteriosus</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PFO= Persistent foramen ovale</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AP= Aorticopulmonary&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IV=&nbsp;Interventricular</p>\r\n", "locales" : [ { "languageCode" : "en-us", "source" : "23video", "referenceId" : "13434058", "referenceToken" : "7496ff78215ea567ea4852b1b32e5a5a", "referenceLocationId" : "12732915", "authToken" : "7a45cc1274895fd65761dcc83e9c8513" } ], "tags" : { "section" : "Embryology", "topic" : [ "embryology", "", "Embryology", "CVS Embryology" ], "info" : [ "foundational", "usmleStep1", "cme" ], "subject" : "Embryology", "system" : "Cardiovascular System", "concentrations" : [  ], "keywords" : [  ], "practice" : [  ] }, "packages" : [ "prohealth", "drbeen-yearly-discount", "drbeen-yearly", "yearly", "unlimited-cme", "unlimited-cme-intro", "unlimited-cme-uaprn", "uaprn-conference", "student-monthly", "student-yearly", "student-coffee-2016", "student-beans-2016", "stgeorge-sprout-2016", "np-sprout-2016", "professional-monthly", "professional-yearly", "drbeen-monthly", "monthly", "limited-student-lifetime", "lifetime-plan", "lifetime-access-special", "lifetime-access-half-price", "lifetime-access-discount", "lifetime-access-promo", "lifetime-access", "lifetime-access-49", "drnajeeb-special", "drnajeeb-cme", "stgeorge-coffee-2016", "np-coffee-2016", "stgeorge-bean-2016", "np-beans-2016", "al-ahli-hospital-pilot", "aanp-special-drnajeeb", "aanp-2017-yearly-access", "aanp-2017-lifetime-access", "drbeen-electives", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "usmle-step-1", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-79", "drbeen-yearly-49", "lifetime-access-1", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-67", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "lifetime-access-27", "drbeen-quarterly", "lifetime-discounted-50", "db-a-lifetime", "drbeen-uaprn", "db-uaprn-2018", "sellular-access", "special-been", "nc-been", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-49", "free-trial-account", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "free-trial-h", "student-monthly-22", "student-lifetime-access", "promotional-been", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-25", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "monthly", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "drbeen-gift", "lifetime-access-67", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "yearly-special", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "summer-discount", "summer-discount" ], "status" : "enabled", "slug" : "ventricles-and-aorticopulmonary-septum", "seq" : 7, "updatedAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-12T16:59:25.278+0000" }, "instructors" : [ { "orderNum" : 1, "user" : { "$oid" : "57c6515c1a4f528e46bc4708" }, "role" : "lead" } ], "shortId" : "B1HfejGRunxb", "access" : "subscription", "datePublished" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:37.000+0000" }, "createdAt" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:37.000+0000" }, "keywords" : [  ], "learningObjectives" : [  ], "ratings" : [  ], "__v" : 1 },

We will look at the sinus venosus and cardinal veins with the regression of some of the systems that eventually lead to the formation of the IVC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>STUDY NOTES:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DEVELOPMENT OF INFERIOR VENA CAVA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sinus venosus forms the inflow tract of the primitive heart tube. On each side of the sinus venosus, the common cardinal veins open into it. Anterior and posterior cardinal veins combine to form the common cardinal vein on each side of the sinus venosus. The common cardinal vein on the right side forms part of the superior vena cava. Besides the common cardinal veins, the umbilical and the vitelline veins also drain into the sinus venosus. On the left side, these veins undergo specific&nbsp;remodeling. This results in formation of specific&nbsp;anastomosis&nbsp;on the left side, giving rise to left to right shunts thereby causing most of the blood to be received by the right side of the sinus venosus. Consequently, the veins of the right side start maturing and increase in size relative to their left side counterparts. As the sinus venosus also grows and matures, it becomes incorporated into the right side of the primitive atrium. Eventually the vitelline, common cardinal and the umbilical veins of the left side degenerate. The blood received by the left side of sinus venosus is greatly reduced and as a result the left side of the sinus venosus shrinks. &nbsp;Inferiorly the posterior cardinal veins&nbsp;anastomose&nbsp;together and form the iliac veins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The formation of the inferior vena&nbsp;cava is contributed by three set of veins:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Anterior &amp; posterior cardinal veins</li>\r\n\t<li>Subcardinal veins</li>\r\n\t<li>Supracardinal veins (develop a little latter)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The anterior cardinal and the common cardinal veins on the left side give rise to&nbsp;brachiocephalic&nbsp;and the left subclavian vein which drain into the SVC. &nbsp;It is important to remember that, the umbilical vein on both sides and the vitelline vein on the left side, all tend to degenerate. &nbsp;The vitelline vein on the right side along with the common cardinal vein of the right side together form parts of the SVC.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The subcardinal veins have an anastomosis in the middle which is referred to as subcardinal venous anastomosis. These subcardinal veins are also connected to the posterior cardinal vein and form another anastomosis&nbsp;which is referred to as the mesonephric shunt. Later on the inferior part of posterior cardinal vein on the left side starts degenerating, however, it&#39;s still connected to the subcardinal vein via the mesonephric shunt. Also, there are tiny buds arising from the subcardinal veins, these form parts of the future ovarian and spermatic veins.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subcardinal veins on the right side separate from the posterior cardinal veins and are joined in by the hepatic veins. This will later form the initial parts of the IVC.&nbsp;At this point it&#39;s important to understand that an anastomosis forms between the supracardinal and the subcardinal veins, which is referred to as the supra-subcardinal anastomosis. This&nbsp;anastomosis&nbsp;becomes part of the IVC and later gives rise to the renal&nbsp;vein and parts of the spermatic veins. Over time the posterior cardinal vein on the right side also degenerates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the IVC is formed, it is composed of the following parts:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>HEPATIC PART&nbsp;comes from the liver sinusoids and the hepatic vein. It also has&nbsp;a contribution from the sinusvenosus.</li>\r\n\t<li>PRERENAL PART&nbsp;of the IVC is contributed by the subcardinal veins. Primarily the right subcardinal vein has a greater contribution in forming this part.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>RIGHT AND LEFT SUPRARENAL VEINS&nbsp;are also parts of the IVC. They&nbsp;also develop from the subcardinal veins.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>RENAL SEGMENT OF THE IVC&nbsp;arises from the mesonephric shunt of the right side. The mesonephric shunt itself forms as a result of the&nbsp;anastomosis&nbsp;between the subcardinal and the posterior cardinal veins. Right renal&nbsp;vein also arises from this renal segment of the IVC. On the left side the mesonephric shunt becomes incorporated into the IVC and gives rise to the left renal vein. The spermatic/ovarian vein on the left side drains into the left renal vein which then opens into the IVC. However, on the right side, the right spermatic/ovarian vein opens directly into the IVC.</li>\r\n\t<li>POSTRENAL SEGMENT OF THE IVC&nbsp;is the region below the renal segment of IVC. Supracardinal veins contribute to the formation of the&nbsp;post renal&nbsp;segment of&nbsp;the IVC.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>ILIAC VEINS&nbsp;form the most inferior parts of the IVC.

The role of ductus arteriosus and its situation just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery will be discussed later into the notes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Ductus venosus connects umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava, allowing the blood to bypass the hepatic route in doing so.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FLOW BEFORE BIRTH</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before birth, two umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the fetus to the placenta. Placenta allows gaseous exchange via diffusion to take place between the maternal oxygenated blood and the fetal deoxygenated blood. It&#39;s important to remember that the fetal and maternal bloods don&#39;t come into direct contact. Prenatally the fetal lungs are collapsed; hence placenta is the site of gaseous exchange before birth. Although the placenta has maternal deoxygenated blood but still it&#39;s able to provide fetus with its oxygen requirements. This is made possible by the higher oxygen affinity of the fetal&nbsp;hemoglobin, HbF. HbF has 2 alpha and two gamma globin chains, which allows it to extract oxygen from a relatively deoxygenated maternal blood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ductus venosus connects umbilical vein (coming from the placenta) to the inferior vena cava, thereby forming a shunt that allows half of the placental blood to bypass the hepatic route. Hence 50% of the oxygenated blood from the placenta enters the hepatic sinusoids. This blood that enters the hepatic sinusoids is returned via the hepatic veins to the inferior vena cava. All of the oxygenated blood doesn&#39;t enter the liver and the hepatic sinusoids because the passage through the hepatic sinusoids can take a very long time for the blood to reach the heart. The oxygenated blood in the IVC (80% oxygen&nbsp;saturation) at this point mixes with the deoxygenated blood from the hepatic veins (26% oxygen saturation). Before entering into the right atrium, the blood in the IVC has an oxygen saturation of around 67%. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A hallmark of fetal circulation is that, the superior vena cava returns deoxygenated blood from the head, neck and upper extremities region to the right atrium. This deoxygenated blood reaching the heart via the SVC is directed into the right ventricle and subsequently into the pulmonary trunk. The inferior vena cava on the other hand brings relatively oxygenated blood&nbsp;(67% Oxygen saturation)&nbsp;to the right atrium, which due to flow dynamics passes through the patent foramen ovale into the left atrium. As discussed in earlier lectures, foramen ovale forms a right to left shunt which allows the oxygenated blood coming from placenta to bypass the pulmonary circuit. After birth, foramen ovale becomes obliterated and forms the fossa ovalis. Once it&#39;s in the left atrium, this relatively oxygenated blood (coming from right atrium via foramen ovale) goes into the left ventricles and subsequently leaves the heart via the aorta. Most of this blood then leaves via the three large branches of aorta (brachiocephalic&nbsp;trunk, left common carotid and the left subclavian arteries) towards the head, neck and upper extremities region. There&#39;s no mixing of the blood coming from SVC and IVC, though they&#39;re both received by the right atrium.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deoxygenated blood (25% oxygen saturation) coming from the SVC entering the right atrium, is directed into the right ventricle and subsequently into the pulmonary trunk. The ductus arteriosus opens into the underside of the aorta, and connects the pulmonary trunk to the arch of aorta. Thus, ductus arteriosus forms a right to left shunt allowing the deoxygenated blood to bypass the pulmonary circuit. This shunting across the pulmonary circuit occurs because fetal pulmonary vascular resistance is very high resulting in just 10% of the right ventricular output goes to the lungs. The rest 90% of right&nbsp;ventricular&nbsp;output is shunted from the pulmonary trunk to the aorta. This deoxygenated blood from the SVC which is in the aorta, now mixes with the relatively more oxygenated blood which came from the placenta and passed through the foramen ovale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned earlier, only 10% of the fetal right ventricular output is directed to the lungs. This blood is brought back to the left atrium by the pulmonary veins and it leaves the left side of the heart via the aorta.&nbsp;The blood in the aorta after the opening of ductus arteriosus is at an oxygen saturation of 60%.&nbsp;This blood via the descending aorta is now directed to the abdomen and lower parts of the fetus and finally reaches the internal iliac arteries. Most of the deoxygenated blood now enters the two umbilical arteries and is taken to the placenta. The umbilical arteries on their route to the placenta touch bladder as well. Later on, the proximal parts of the umbilical arteries later form the superior vesical arteries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Levels of oxygen saturation in different fetal vessels&nbsp;in decreasing order of oxygen saturation:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Umbilical Vein</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Ductus Venosus&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;IVC &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Right Atrium &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PRENATAL SHUNTS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before birth there are 3 vascular shunts which allow bypass of the blood flow mainly around the lungs and the liver. These 3 shunts are right to left in direction and tend to close immediately after birth. These shunts are as following:</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>SHUNT</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>ORGAN BYPASSED</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Ductus Arteriosus</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Lungs</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Foramen Ovale</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Lungs</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Ductus Venosus</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Liver</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier there was a brief mention of the high pulmonary vascular resistance and need for a shunt across the pulmonary circuit. Let&rsquo;s touch that subject now in order to gain more clarity on this concept. Before birth the fetal lungs are collapsed. Since the fetus is inside the womb surrounded by amniotic fluid, the lungs are also filled with fluid and this keeps them collapsed. Since the lungs are collapsed as a result the pulmonary arterioles are also collapsed. This is because, the alveoli are filled with fluid at this point and the surrounding arterioles tend to exhibit vasoconstriction due to this resultant hypoxia (due to absence of oxygen in the alveoli). This hypoxic pulmonary arteriolar vasoconstriction results in a very high pulmonary vascular resistance and as a consequence the lungs remain in a collapsed state before birth. Since the right ventricle has to pump against a very high pulmonary vascular resistance, it results in the right ventricle being more hypertrophied than the left ventricle before birth. Fortunately only 10% of the right ventricular output flows to the lungs (other 90% is shunted across the pulmonary circulation by DA in the aorta) so the degree of hypertrophy isn&#39;t that pronounced at the time of birth. This situation is reversed within one month after the birth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FLOW AFTER BIRTH, REASON FOR FLOW CHANGES &amp; THE CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES INVOLVED</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After birth, the 3 above mentioned shunts tend to close because of changes in pressure gradients and in oxygen tension. Immediately after birth, as the newborn breathes the lungs become expanded. As the alveoli expand, the pulmonary vasculature also tends to expands due to decreased effects of hypoxic&nbsp;pulmonary vascular resistance. This results in an overall decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance and blood from the right ventricle is directed via the pulmonary trunk towards the pulmonary circulation. The increased pulmonary blood flow to the lungs also results in an increased pulmonary venous return to the left atrium. Consequently left ventricular output increases and the aorta receives more blood resulting in an increase in aortic blood pressure. Hence, the increased pressure in the aorta tends to reverse the shunt across the ductus arteriosus. Overall the pressure on the left side of the heart tends to increase more than the right side of the heart. As the lungs become functional, the following changes occur:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Increased bradykinin levels&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Increased oxygen tension (more than 50mm of Hg)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Decreased PGE2 and prostacyclin levels</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, there&#39;s an increased oxygen tension due to expansion of lungs and an increased released of bradykinin from the lungs. Following this, there&#39;s an immediate drop in PGE2 and prostacyclin levels which were being produced as a result of hypoxia. Prostaglandin E actually is an inhibitor of contracting response of ductus arteriosus to an increased oxygen tension. An oxygen tension above 50 mm of Hg promotes the closure of the ductus arteriosus. Therefore, all the above mentioned changes result in the contraction of specialized smooth muscle in the walls of ductus venosus and ductus arteriosus. Consequently, DV and DA become obliterated over the next couple of hours after birth. Failure of the ductus arteriosus results in a patent ductus arteriosus after birth. The closure of ductus arteriosus is a slow event and it&#39;s summarized below:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Within few hours</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>DA starts constricting</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Within 24 hours</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Obliterated in 40% of newborns</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Within 48 hours&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Obliterated in 80% of newborns</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Within 96 hours</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Obliterated in 100% of newborns</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;umbilical&nbsp;vein also closes upon birth as the&nbsp;umbilicus&nbsp;is clipped and the connection between the placenta and the fetus is severed. Closure of umbilical vein reduces the amount of blood flowing via the inferior vena cava into the right atrium. Hence the right atrial pressure tends to further drop relative to left atrial pressure. The increased left atrial pressure results in fusion of the septum primum and secundum and the foramen ovale is subsequently closed. Closed foramen ovale is referred to as fossa ovalis. The floor of the fossa ovalis is formed by the septum&nbsp;primum&nbsp;and its margin called the limbus ovalis is derived from the septum secundum. Closure of the foramen ovale means that the right heart is connected to the pulmonary circulation and the left heart is connected to the systemic circulation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the umbilical connection to the placenta is&nbsp;severed&nbsp;after birth, the ductus venosus also begins to start closing. The closure of ductus vensosus is a slow process and it can take a month after birth to completely become obliterated. In cases where the newborn is anemic, the ductus venosus can&nbsp;be cannulated from the outside to initiate a blood replacement therapy. Adult&nbsp;remnant&nbsp;of the ductus venosus is referred to as the ligamentum venosum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>REMANANTS IN ADULTS FROM THE FETAL CIRCULATORY SYSTEM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Postnatal changes which occur after birth result in formation of some adult remnants from the fetal circulatory system.

It connects aorta to the pulmonary trunk just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery and forms a right to left shunt. This right to left shunt enables most of the right ventricular output to bypass the pulmonary circuit because the lungs are collapsed at this time and as a result the pulmonary vascular resistance is quite high. The ductus arteriosus is composed of specialized smooth muscle which releases PGE2 and prostacyclins in response to low oxygen tension/ relevant hypoxia. The PGE2 and prostacyclins release tends to keep the ductus arteriosus open before birth. Normally, the ductus arteriosus closes within few hours after birth due to contraction of the smooth muscle in its wall and is referred to as ligamentum arteriosum.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congenital condition which can cause hypoxia after birth can prevent the ductus arteriosus from closing. One such condition is erythroblastosis fetalis. As mentioned earlier, the low oxygen tension due to hypoxia can cause a release of prostaglandins and prostacyclins which will prevent the ductus arteriosus from closing.&nbsp;Other than that, babies born with a preductal coarctation of aorta tend to have a patent ductus arteriosus which should be kept open. In case of preductal coarctation, the ductus arteriosus remains patent and provides blood flow into the descending aorta and thereby the abdomen and lower parts of the body. In situations where a left to right shunt is important for the survival of the newborn, the ductus arteriosus is necessary to be kept patent. Congenital heart defects such as transposition of great vessels requires such an intervention to keep the ductus arteriosus open. Prostaglandin E analogues such as dinoprostone, are administered in such cases which helps in keeping the ductus arteriosus patent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In preterm babies, the lungs aren&#39;t fully developed, therefore after birth there is a decreased arterial oxygen tension and an increased prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclins synthesis in response to this relative hypoxia. Hence, the incidence of a patent ductus arteriosus is very high in preterm/premature infants. Patent ductus arteriosus results in a left to right shunt after birth, which is non-cyanotic and the newborn has a machine-like murmur audible upon auscultation. In such cases, prostaglandin E inhibitors such as&nbsp;indomethacin&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>ibuprofen are&nbsp;administered in order to promote the closure of ductus arteriosus.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foramen ovale: to keep the foramen ovale open in TGA atrial septoplasty is done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The situation of ductus arteriosus just distal to the origin of left subclavian artery has great significance. Most of the oxygenated blood entering the right atrium is directed towards the head and neck region via the 3 branches large branches of the arch of aorta. Just distal to the origin of subclavian artery, the aorta is connected to the pulmonary trunk via the ductus arteriosus. At this point the deoxygenated blood (coming originally from the SVC) in the pulmonary trunk is shunted into the aorta (via DA) and is allowed to mix with the oxygenated blood which originally came from the placenta. Hence, most of the oxygenated blood from the placenta directed to the head and neck region which at that that point of development has greater oxygen demands. This remaining blood in the aorta, after it has mixed with the shunted deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary trunk, has an oxygen saturation of 50% and is now directed to the rest of the body (abdomen and lower limb).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "locales" : [ { "languageCode" : "en-us", "source" : "23video", "referenceId" : "13434063", "referenceToken" : "89a620903213d124ffc14cd98996290f", "referenceLocationId" : "12732914", "authToken" : "8f6499fc3d24ce1546835693ce731db8" } ], "tags" : { "section" : "Embryology", "topic" : [ "embryology", "", "Embryology", "CVS Embryology" ], "info" : [ "foundational", "usmleStep1", "cme" ], "subject" : "Embryology", "system" : "Cardiovascular System", "concentrations" : [  ], "keywords" : [  ], "practice" : [  ] }, "packages" : [ "prohealth", "drbeen-yearly-discount", "drbeen-yearly", "yearly", "unlimited-cme", "unlimited-cme-intro", "unlimited-cme-uaprn", "uaprn-conference", "student-monthly", "student-yearly", "student-coffee-2016", "student-beans-2016", "stgeorge-sprout-2016", "np-sprout-2016", "professional-monthly", "professional-yearly", "drbeen-monthly", "monthly", "limited-student-lifetime", "lifetime-plan", "lifetime-access-special", "lifetime-access-half-price", "lifetime-access-discount", "lifetime-access-promo", "lifetime-access", "lifetime-access-49", "drnajeeb-special", "drnajeeb-cme", "stgeorge-coffee-2016", "np-coffee-2016", "stgeorge-bean-2016", "np-beans-2016", "al-ahli-hospital-pilot", "aanp-special-drnajeeb", "aanp-2017-yearly-access", "aanp-2017-lifetime-access", "drbeen-electives", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "usmle-step-1", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-79", "drbeen-yearly-49", "lifetime-access-1", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-67", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "lifetime-access-27", "drbeen-quarterly", "lifetime-discounted-50", "db-a-lifetime", "drbeen-uaprn", "db-uaprn-2018", "sellular-access", "special-been", "nc-been", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-49", "free-trial-account", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "free-trial-h", "student-monthly-22", "student-lifetime-access", "promotional-been", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-25", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "monthly", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "drbeen-gift", "lifetime-access-67", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "yearly-special", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "summer-discount", "summer-discount" ], "status" : "enabled", "slug" : "fetal-circulation", "seq" : 10, "updatedAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-12T16:59:25.287+0000" }, "instructors" : [ { "orderNum" : 1, "user" : { "$oid" : "57c6515c1a4f528e46bc4708" }, "role" : "lead" } ], "shortId" : "BJuMgjG0Onxb", "access" : "subscription", "datePublished" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:37.000+0000" }, "createdAt" : { "$date" : "2017-04-14T21:05:37.000+0000" }, "keywords" : [  ], "learningObjectives" : [  ], "ratings" : [  ], "__v" : 1 },

Before delving into&nbsp;the details about&nbsp;individual components of the vasculature, an understanding about the general structure of the blood vessel will be discussed. A standard blood vessel is composed of three layers, which are discussed as following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>TUNICA INTIMA&nbsp;forms the innermost layer of any vessel. Tunica intima itself is composed of three component layers. Endothelium forms the innermost aspect of the tunica intima. Surrounding the endothelium is a connective tissue layer called the subendothelial layer. Subendothelial layer has a varying amount of elastic and smooth muscle fiber depending on the type of vessel. In elastic arteries the density of elastic and smooth muscle fibers is higher compared to smaller arteries. Outermost component of the tunica intima is the internal elastic lamina.</li>\r\n\t<li>TUNICA MEDIA&nbsp;forms the middle layer of the vessel. It is mostly composed of the elastic and smooth muscle fibers which are arranged in a circular pattern. Tunica media is surrounded by the external elastic lamina.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>TUNICA ADVENTITIA&nbsp;forms the outermost layer of any vessel. Vasa vasorum are present in the tunica adventitia layer&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>In various types of vessels these above mentioned layers would be either present or absent. If present, the composition and thickness of these layers can slightly vary from one vessel type to another.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TYPES OF VASCULATURE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ARTERIES&nbsp;conduct blood away from the heart towards the tissues. Arteries normally carry oxygenated blood away from the heart. However,&nbsp;exceptions to this rule are&nbsp;the pulmonary arteries and the umbilical arteries which carry deoxygenated blood away from the heart.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elastic arteries are larger in size and have a relatively thick tunica media. Examples of elastic arteries include the pulmonary arteries and aorta&nbsp;plus its 3 major branches (left brachiocephalic, right common carotid &amp; the right subclavian arteries).&nbsp;Tunica media is so large in the case of aorta, that it has 50 layers of alternating elastic and smooth muscle fibers present in an alternating circular pattern. Elastic arteries are also referred to as the conducting arteries. Their main function is to receive high pressure blood from the heart and distend outwards keeping the blood there before they slowly return to their normal&nbsp;caliber&nbsp;and gently push the blood forward as the heart enters diastole phase. This is called the&nbsp;windkesseleffect&nbsp;and it prevents any turbulence of the high&nbsp;pressure blood which leaves the heart. Hence, the elastic component allows the elastic arteries to recoil appropriately and serve their function as conducting vessels. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Endothelium is the innermost layer of the tunica intima and this is surrounded by the subendothelial layer. In case of arteries, the subendothelial layer has a&nbsp;lot of elastic and smooth muscle fibers. Subendothelial layer is the&nbsp;part of the tunica intima that&nbsp;is most commonly involved in atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is an intimal disease which results in formation of atheromatous plaques within the subendothelial layer of the tunica intima. Atherosclerosis most commonly affects the medium and large sized arteries. This plaque formation tends to decrease the luminal size&nbsp;of the vessels and consequently the blood which flows across them. Arteries have abundant smooth muscle and elastic fibers in their tunica media, which gives&nbsp;them the recoil capability. Tunica adventitia forms the outermost layer. Small vessels called the vasa vasorum are located within the tunica adventitia, and they function to vascularize the wall of the walls of the elastic arteries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baroreceptors and chemoreceptor are present within the walls of carotid sinus and the arch of aorta. Baroreceptors are formed by the thinning of the wall of these arteries. This allows the increased blood pressure to have a more pronounced effect in distending the arterial wall in this region where the baroreceptors are located. There are nerves located in the adventitia of the baroreceptor region which sense this stretch of&nbsp;the vessel and send impulses if there&rsquo;s a significant rise or drop in blood pressure.&nbsp;Similarly there are chemical receptors that are also&nbsp;present within the muscular wall of the arch of aorta. These chemoreceptors are formed by Glomus type 1 cells which are situated within&nbsp;the walls of the arch of aorta. These Glomus type 1 cells have channels for oxygen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions; this allows them to act as sensory receptors for the monitoring&nbsp;the concentrations of oxygen &amp;&nbsp;carbon dioxide plus the pH of the arterial blood. Glomus&nbsp;type 1 cells are supported by the satellite receptors. These receptors respond to hypoxia, hypercapnia (increased&nbsp;arterial CO2 levels) and the pH changes in the arterial blood. Any derangements of these&nbsp;above mentioned parameters result&nbsp;in firing of the glomus cells thereby activating the corresponding control mechanism to ensure&nbsp;homeostasiswithin the body.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Muscular arteries arise from the larger elastic arteries. They are also referred to as the conducting arteries and they supply blood to various organs of the body. These muscular arteries mainly respond to sympathetic/adrenergic control because of the presence of alpha 1and beta 2 receptors. Sympathetic stimulation is responsible for the vasoconstriction effect in these arteries. They do have an endothelial and subendothelial layer. The smooth and elastic fiber layer in the subendothelium is not that dense. Their tunica media is composed of 3 to 10 layers of smooth muscle and elastic fibers. Outermost layer is formed by the tunica adventitia. Muscular arteries are also referred to as resistance vessels. This is because they exhibit vasoconstriction upon sympathetic&nbsp;stimulation;&nbsp;hence they can change their diameter. Upon decreasing their diameter, they can decrease the forward flow hence they are called resistance vessels. The volume of blood in the muscular arteries is referred to as stressed volume, since these arteries are always compressingupon the blood inside&nbsp;them&nbsp;to help maintain the blood pressure. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;ARTERIOLES&nbsp;form the terminal arterial vessels and form&nbsp;a connection between the arteries and the capillaries. Arterioles form the major resistance site of the systemic vasculature and therefore, they are&nbsp;responsible&nbsp;for maintaining the blood pressure. The arterioles are also referred to as the functional sphincters of the arterial system. Within the tunica intima, they do have an endothelial and subendothelial layer. Subendothelial layer is not that dense in elastic and muscle fibers. Their tunica media has 1 to 3 layers of smooth muscle and elastic fibers. This tunica media responds to sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation. Sympathetic stimulation&nbsp;achieves&nbsp;vasoconstriction of&nbsp;the arterioles and results in a decreased forward flow&nbsp;through them. In contrast, the&nbsp;parasympathetic stimulation&nbsp;achieves&nbsp;vasodilatation&nbsp;of the arterioles, which results&nbsp;in an increased forward flow across the arteriole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the case of skin, gastrointestinal system and the renal system;&nbsp;the sympathetic stimulation of their arterioles is modulated via the alpha-1&nbsp;receptors. The arterioles leading to the skeletal muscles are controlled by beta 2 receptors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAPILLARIES have the smallest&nbsp;caliber&nbsp;in terms of luminal diameter. Though the capillaries have a small diameter, but they have the greatest cross-sectional area amongst all the vasculature. The total cross-sectional area of all the capillaries in the body can add up 2/3 of a meter. Also they have the largest surface area relative to all the blood vessels in the body. The tunica intima of capillaries is only composed of an&nbsp;endothelium&nbsp;and a basement membrane. The endothelium is formed by a single layer of endothelial cells which allows them to function as sites of exchange. Tunica media and adventitia are absent in the capillaries. Capillaries function as the exchange site of the vasculature because they exhibit selective&nbsp;permeability&nbsp;of substances across their walls. This permeability allows diffusion of oxygen, nutrients,&nbsp;signalingmolecules and water from the blood to the tissues. Carbon dioxide and waste products diffuse in the opposite direction from the tissues into the capillaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the capillaries merge together they end up forming&nbsp;VENULES. The venules have an endothelium and a broken subendothelium but they lack tunica media and adventitia. They are normally collapsed and have a low blood pressure. Venules are also involved in exchange of metabolites with the surrounding tissue. Another important function of venules is diapedesis which involves cellular trafficking across wall of the venules. This made possible by endothelial contraction which allows gaps to appear within the endothelium of the postcapillary venules. This diapedesis allows venules to function as sites of leukocyte extraction into the tissues. Inflammatory mediators released from the inflamed tissues allow leukocyte recruitment and via diapedesis leukocyte trafficking occurs into the tissue space. This allows leukocytes to take active part at the site of inflammation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>VEINS&nbsp;are formed when the venules merge together. The veins function as a&nbsp;reservoir of the blood since 2/3rd of the total blood volume is present in the veins at any given time. Veins transport blood away from the tissues and return it to the heart. Veins normally carry deoxygenated blood, except the pulmonary veins in adults and the umbilical vein during fetal life which bring back oxygenated blood to the heart from the lungs and the placenta respectively. Veins as compared to arteries are thin walled, more compliant &amp; distensible, have a greater luminal diameter and have valves which prevent the backward flow of blood. Veins lack the elastic and muscular component hence when the blood backflows under the&nbsp;influence&nbsp;of gravity, the valves tend to approximate&nbsp;and prevent the retrograde flow of blood.&nbsp;In contrast to venules, larger veins have more defined endothelium &amp; subendothelium and they have a tunica media as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "locales" : [ { "languageCode" : "en-us", "source" : "23video", "referenceId" : "13434051", "referenceToken" : "e4a4e66715de78305f1334b53bac8d6c", "referenceLocationId" : "12732912", "authToken" : "dd24011eeaa34b6e29f939ff9c494a27" } ], "tags" : { "section" : "Blood Vessels", "topic" : [ "anatomy", "", "Anatomy", "Histology" ], "info" : [ "foundational", "usmleStep1", "cme" ], "subject" : "Histology", "system" : "Cardiovascular System", "concentrations" : [  ], "keywords" : [  ], "practice" : [  ] }, "packages" : [ "prohealth", "drbeen-yearly-discount", "drbeen-yearly", "yearly", "unlimited-cme", "unlimited-cme-intro", "unlimited-cme-uaprn", "uaprn-conference", "student-monthly", "student-yearly", "student-coffee-2016", "student-beans-2016", "stgeorge-sprout-2016", "np-sprout-2016", "professional-monthly", "professional-yearly", "drbeen-monthly", "monthly", "limited-student-lifetime", "lifetime-plan", "lifetime-access-special", "lifetime-access-half-price", "lifetime-access-discount", "lifetime-access-promo", "lifetime-access", "lifetime-access-49", "drnajeeb-special", "drnajeeb-cme", "stgeorge-coffee-2016", "np-coffee-2016", "stgeorge-bean-2016", "np-beans-2016", "al-ahli-hospital-pilot", "aanp-special-drnajeeb", "aanp-2017-yearly-access", "aanp-2017-lifetime-access", "drbeen-electives", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "usmle-step-1", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-79", "drbeen-yearly-49", "lifetime-access-1", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-67", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "lifetime-access-27", "drbeen-quarterly", "lifetime-discounted-50", "db-a-lifetime", "drbeen-uaprn", "db-uaprn-2018", "sellular-access", "special-been", "nc-been", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-49", "free-trial-account", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "free-trial-h", "student-monthly-22", "student-lifetime-access", "promotional-been", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-25", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "monthly", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "drbeen-gift", "lifetime-access-67", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "yearly-special", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "summer-discount", "summer-discount" ], "status" : "enabled", "slug" : "blood-vessel-histology", "seq" : 0, "updatedAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-07T18:11:54.533+0000" }, "instructors" : [ { "orderNum" : 1, "user" : { "$oid" : "57c6515c1a4f528e46bc4708" }, "role" : "lead" } ], "shortId" : "H1tGeizRO2e-", "access" : "subscription", "createdAt" : { "$date" : "2017-09-12T14:26:38.552+0000" }, "keywords" : [  ], "learningObjectives" : [  ], "ratings" : [  ], "__v" : 1, "datePublished" : { "$date" : "2017-09-12T14:26:38.552+0000" } },

It is similar in pathology to PSVT but the location could be anywhere instead of near the coronary sinus (<a href=\"https://www.drbeen.com/view/atrial-flutter/S1WDeozAuhgZ\">study our lecture on atrial flutter</a>.) Due to the focus being away from the SA node, the P wave&rsquo;s shape can be different but consistent. Usually, there also is a&nbsp;<em>warm-up and cooling-down period</em>.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>MAT</strong>&nbsp;is due to many reentrant circuits (but not as many as in the atrial fibrillation). Because of multiple foci present in many locations in the atria, you will find P waves of many shapes. To diagnose a MAT you must identify three different shapes of the P waves in the EKG.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>One more difference of the MAT and PAT from the PSVT is that&nbsp;<strong>carotid massage</strong>&nbsp;does not affect the heart rate in these conditions. Note:&nbsp;study this&nbsp;lecture&nbsp;to understand why it is difficult to cure arrhythmia due to reentrant circuits. (Hint: structural changes.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MAT and PAT both have the common presentation of 100 to 200 bpm heart rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visit drbeen.com for more lectures:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drbeen.com/\">https://www.drbeen.com/</a></p>\r\n", "ratings" : [  ], "status" : "enabled", "packages" : [ "drbeen-yearly-discount", "drbeen-yearly", "unlimited-cme", "student-monthly", "student-yearly", "student-coffee-2016", "student-beans-2016", "np-sprout-2016", "stgeorge-sprout-2016", "professional-monthly", "professional-yearly", "drbeen-monthly", "limited-student-lifetime", "lifetime-plan", "lifetime-coffee-2016", "lifetime-access-special", "lifetime-access-half-price", "lifetime-access-discount", "lifetime-access-promo", "lifetime-access", "ekg-interpretation-course", "drnajeeb-special", "stgeorge-coffee-2016", "np-coffee-2016", "stgeorge-bean-2016", "np-beans-2016", "al-ahli-hospital-pilot", "aanp-special-drnajeeb", "aanp-2017-yearly-access", "aanp-2017-lifetime-access", "lifetime-access-49", "unlimited-cme-intro", "unlimited-cme-intro", "unlimited-cme-intro", "unlimited-cme-intro", "drnajeeb-cme", "uaprn-conference", "prohealth", "prohealth", "unlimited-cme-uaprn", "monthly", "yearly", "drbeen-electives", "USMLE-Step-1", "USMLE-Step-1", "usmle-step-1", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-lifetime-1300", "drbeen-yearly-500", "drbeen-yearly-79", "drbeen-yearly-49", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-67", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "lifetime-access-27", "drbeen-quarterly", "lifetime-discounted-50", "db-a-lifetime", "drbeen-uaprn", "db-uaprn-2018", "sellular-access", "special-been", "nc-been", "lifetime-access-39", "lifetime-access-49", "lifetime-access-49", "free-trial-account", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "db-h-special", "free-trial-h", "student-monthly-22", "student-lifetime-access", "promotional-been", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-97", "lifetime-access-25", "lifetime-access-25", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "drbeen-su-lifetime", "free-trial-account", "free-trial-account", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "drbeen-p-lifetime", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "best-cme-yearly-plan-199", "monthly", "monthly", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "drbeen-lifetime-access", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "march-madness-monthly", "drbeen-gift", "drbeen-gift", "lifetime-access-67", "cvs-family-practice-package", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "lifetime-special", "yearly-special", "yearly-special", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "2-1-monthly", "summer-discount", "summer-discount", "summer-discount" ], "instructors" : [ { "orderNum" : 1, "user" : { "$oid" : "57c6515c1a4f528e46bc4708" }, "_id" : { "$oid" : "59848e93f60aaa00044be019" }, "role" : "lead" } ], "tags" : { "system" : "Cardiovascular System", "subject" : "EKG", "section" : "EKG Understanding and Interpretation", "info" : [ "special", "clinical", "foundational", "cme" ], "keywords" : [  ], "practice" : [ "family medicine", "internal medicine", "cardiology", "anesthesiology" ], "topic" : [ "", "EKG Interpretation", "EKG" ], "concentrations" : [  ] }, "access" : "subscription", "keywords" : [  ], "learningObjectives" : [  ], "locales" : [ { "authToken" : "bc7d0769597dc32d34b421eb7b7ff76a", "referenceLocationId" : "16107557", "referenceToken" : "ab72dc792a3b05c635a8d92540e718ac", "referenceId" : "18444406", "languageCode" : "en-US", "source" : "23video" } ], "shortId" : "HygpsD2d8Z", "__v" : 1, "seq" : 11, "datePublished" : { "$date" : "2017-07-28T13:09:58.034+0000" } },

In such patients, cardioversion will fail.

Pneumominae are gram positive (G+). Hence, they look purple under the microscope with the gram staining.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.drbeen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gram-positive.svg\" style=\"height:171px; width:100px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><small><strong>Figure 1: gram positive (purple in color) pneumococci are spear shaped and usually found in pairs. </strong></small></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Catalase Negative&nbsp;</strong>These pathogens are catalase negative.

To remember this, remember these pathogens opt to live away from the chin i.e. these live in pharynx.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.drbeen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/optochin-sensitive.png\" style=\"height:200px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><small><strong>Figure 4: optochin sensitive.

In this test,&nbsp;we have a number of latex beads coated with a specific antibody. In the case of pneumococci the antibodies are anti-pneumococcal-antibodies.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen a patient&rsquo;s serum that contains pneumococcal antigens is added to the preparation with anti-pneumococcal-antibodies the antigens&nbsp;bind&nbsp;with the antibodies on the beads. This binding causes the antigen and antibodies to agglutinate.&nbsp;Latex beads agglutinate&nbsp;as if they are stitched together by the antigen-antibody reaction. We can observe the agglutination&nbsp;in a positive test.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.drbeen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/latex-agglutination-test.png\" style=\"height:669px; width:1024px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<small><strong>Figure 5: latex agglutination test. Agglutination is observed when pneumococcal antigens bind with anti-pneumococcal antibodies coated on the latex beads.</strong></small></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"marker\">The importance of the latex agglutination test is that it can be used when the patient has already received a few doses of antibiotics.</span> For example, when you cannot wait to start the antibiotics due to a patient&rsquo;s condition, but, you also want to identify the specific pathogen to treat. This is why it is the test of choice when culture will not show up positive due to a few doses of antibody&rsquo;s already administered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Positive Quellung Test</strong>&nbsp;all capsular pathogens swell when placed in a medium that contains antibodies to their capsules. Once swollen the capsule&nbsp;refract light. When this swollen pathogen is observed under a microscope a clear area is observed where the pathogen&rsquo;s capsule is. <em>To remember this we will put a splatter of India ink around our pneumococcus character. Imagine that pneumococcus has moped up an area around it that looks clear.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.drbeen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/quellung-positive.png\" style=\"height:665px; width:1025px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><small><strong>Figure 6: Quellung test.

This means that these pathogens&nbsp;do&nbsp;not need oxygen for making energy, and also the presence of oxygen does not kill them. <em>Let&rsquo;s remember that by drawing an airtight glass mask on the face of our pathogen.</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Teichoeic acid</strong> from the pathogen&rsquo;s cell surface passes through the capsule and appears on the outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alpha Hemolytic</strong> S. Pnsumoniae are alpha hemolytic. That is, they break some RBCs on a blood agar. Hemoglobin spills from the broken RBCs and turns green due to oxidation.

There are many others that we will skip for our level.<br />\r\n<strong>IgA Protease</strong> helps prevents trapping of the pathogen in mucin which occurs when host&rsquo;s IgA binds to pathogen with it&rsquo;s Fc portion. IgA protease breaks IgA by attacking it at its hinge region.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<em>Let&rsquo;s remember that by an arm of the pathogen holding a hammer that breaks the IgAs. The shape of the hammer looks like an IgA for your recall.</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Pneumolysin</strong> binds to the cholesterol in the cell membranes and creates a pore through which cell contents are spilled out.<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.drbeen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/antigens.png\" style=\"height:916px; width:1024px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><small><strong>Figure 9: S.

Viridans as well. This special attention is given&nbsp;because differentiating between these two pathogens is essential for exams and your clinical practice.&nbsp;Getting back to the S. viridans, these bacteria are rounded or elongated and are catalase negative. Of course as usual we will depict catalase negative pathogens as snakes that bite cats - no cats for the mean snakes.&nbsp;These bacteria form short to long chains. To show this, we will make them into long snake-like characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.drbeen.com/articles/viridans/s.+viridans+large+group.png\" style=\"height:178px; width:256px\" /><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.drbeen.com/articles/viridans/s.+viridans+short+chain.png\" style=\"height:178px; width:181px\" /><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.drbeen.com/articles/viridans/s.+viridans+leaf.png\" style=\"height:178px; width:267px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<address><big><strong>Figure 1: a large group of pathogens with similar properties are included in the S.

Hence, the quellung test is&nbsp;negative.&nbsp;So far we saw <strong>two properties</strong> that separate S. Viridans from S. Pneumoniae. Can you guess which ones? These are, 1)&nbsp;S. Pneumoniae live in pairs, while S. Viridans make chains. &nbsp;And, 2)&nbsp;S. pneumoniae are encapsulated which makes quellung test positive for them, while S. Viridans are not encapsulated, hence,&nbsp;quellung test is negative for S. viridans.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The word viridan means green. We will depict this by putting green leaves in their diagrams.&nbsp;These bacteria are called green because these are alpha hemolytic. These pathogens partially break down blood on the blood agar. Hemoglobin oxidation produces a green colored product. Remember that the S. Pneumoniae are also alpha hemolytic.&nbsp;To show this, let&rsquo;s make a few RBCs. Some of these are partially broken. They have green blood coming out of them which will help you remember the greenish discoloration caused by S. viridans on the blood agar.&nbsp;Viridans can be alpha, beta, or non-hemolytic. But, for our level, it is sufficient to remember that these are alpha hemolytic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.drbeen.com/articles/viridans/alpha+hemolysis.png\" style=\"height:512px; width:768px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<address><strong><big>Figure 2: S.

S. viridans are not bile soluble. So, they are not afraid of the bile. We will show this by making them happily living in the bile bottles.&nbsp;Secondly, these pathogens are optochin resistant.&nbsp;Because these pathogens live on teeth as well as oropharynx, we can say that they <span class=\"marker\">opt to live near the chin</span>. This should help you remember that they are not afraid of the optoCHIN.&nbsp;To depict this, let us use the diagram we made in S. pneumoniae of bile bottles in teeth of a skull. Imagine that the S. viridans live in these bile bottles.&nbsp;Remember that the S. pneumoniae, on the other hand, are bile soluble and optochin sensitive. This is an important difference of the S. viridans and S. pneumoniae.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.drbeen.com/articles/viridans/optochin+resistant.png\" style=\"height:512px; width:592px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<address><big><strong>Figure 3: S.

Let&rsquo;s look at the major subgroups.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><br />\r\nMajor Subgroups and Pathogens They Contain</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"marker\">Subgroup names are Mitis, Salivarisu, Mutans, and Anginosus.&nbsp;</span>To help you remember this we will make a girl engy, a mite, and a mutant ninja turtle playing cards sitting on the tongue that is wet with saliva.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\" https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.drbeen.com/articles/viridans/s.+viridans+subgroups+mnemonic.png\" style=\"height:768px; width:1184px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<address><big><strong>Figure 4: Engy (anginosus) sitting on the tongue wet with saliva (salivarius)&nbsp;with mutant ninja turtle (mutans) and a&nbsp;mite (mitis), playing cards.</strong></big></address>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Pathogens within the subgroups</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Bacteria in mitis group are <span class=\"marker\">S. mitis, S. Sanguis/sanguinis, S. parasanguis, S. gordonii, S. crista, S. infantis, S. oralis, S. peroris</span></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Salivarius group contains <span class=\"marker\">S. salivarius, S. vestibularis, S. thermophilus</span></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Mutans group has <span class=\"marker\">S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. criceti, S. rattus, S. downei, S. macacae</span></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Anginosus group contains <span class=\"marker\">S. anginosus, S. constellatus, and S. intermedius</span></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Infections</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Dental carries</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Subacute bacterial endocarditis</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Abscesses in the brain and the liver.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>S. Mutans and Mitis primarily cause dental plaques and carries.&nbsp;They ferment sugars in the mouth which causes acidic environment. <span class=\"marker\">This acidity causes dental damage and cavities in the teeth.&nbsp;</span>To help you remember this let&rsquo;s make a snake coming out of the bile bottle and biting a tooth.&nbsp;When we brush, chew our food, or have dental procedures, these bacteria enter our bloodstream through newly formed injuries.&nbsp;They can&nbsp;settle on the heart valves,&nbsp;provided that the heart valve has already been&nbsp;damaged by a previous disease, for example, rheumatic fever, or congenital abnormality, or valvular prolapse.&nbsp;<span class=\"marker\">Most common species to damage the heart valves is S. sanguinis. Sanguinis means blood.</span> This will help you remember that the sanguinis causes infection of the heart valves.&nbsp;To settle on the valves, these bacteria use dextrans. They make dextran and have them on the outer cell wall.&nbsp;Once hooked on to the atrioventricular valves (mostly bicuspid or mitral valve) they start growing slowly and make piles of bacterial colonies.&nbsp;This, in turn, causes valvular damage resulting in low-grade fever, fatigue, anemia, and regurgitant murmur due to valvular insufficiency. <span class=\"marker\">This is called subacute bacterial endocarditis or SBE.</span>&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s depict this by showing that the bacteria are biting the heart valve with their teeth made of dextrans. And, then making piles and piles of more bacteria on the valve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.drbeen.com/articles/viridans/s.+viridans+carries+and+sbe.png\" style=\"height:512px; width:883px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<address><big><strong>Figure 5: Engy (anginosus) sitting on the tongue wet with saliva (salivarius)&nbsp;with mutant ninja turtle (mutans) and a&nbsp;mite (mitis), playing cards.</strong></big></address>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>This is a good time to also note that the infections of the right atrioventricular valve usually are caused by staphylococci that are introduced in the bloodstream by frequent use of needles in addicts.&nbsp;Another important fact to keep in mind is that the streptococci work in a team to damage the heart valves. First Streptococcus pyogenes causes the heart damage. Then the streptococci viridans infect these already damaged valves.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>S. Anginosus</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>S. viridans&rsquo; group named S. anginosus lives in the GIT. This group is associated with brain and liver abscesses.&nbsp;These may be the only pathogen found in the abscess or they may be found mixed with anaerobes like Bacteroides fragilis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><br />\r\nTreatment</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(Disclaimer, treatments are not directed at a specific patient.

S. Aureus is the normal flora of <span class=\"marker\">nares</span> and to a lesser extent the throat. S. Epidermidis is the normal flora of the <span class=\"marker\">skin</span> and S. Saprophyticus is usually found in the <span class=\"marker\">perineal area of men and women and genital tract of women</span>. It is a frequent cause of UTI in young sexually active women. (<span class=\"marker\">Honeymoon cystitis</span> is usually caused by S. Saprophyticus.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.drbeen.com/articles/Staphylococci/023.png\" style=\"height:563px; width:1025px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Infections</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>These are usually <span class=\"marker\">opportunistic</span> and cause infections of <span class=\"marker\">skin, bones, heart, urinary tract, spleen, prosthesis, wounds</span>, etc. Remember the most virulent and infectious species is S. Aureus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus also called MRSA (mursa) is notorious for causing infections in hospitalized patients.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.drbeen.com/articles/Staphylococci/024.png\" style=\"height:563px; width:1025px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Important Points</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly Staphylococci can cause infections in both the aerobic and anaerobic conditions, at high temperature ranges, and these bad bugs grow in high salt conditions too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.drbeen.com/articles/Staphylococci/025.png\" style=\"height:563px; width:1025px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Morphology</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>These pathogens are spherical, non-motile, and make irregular grape like colonies. Their size ranges between 0.5 to 1.5 micrometer.&nbsp;Many species are capsular.&nbsp;These pathogens also form a biofilm or a slime layer around them. This biofilm helps them stick to catheters and tissues while also helping them escape phagocytosis.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Important Proteins</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Some important proteins these bugs possess to tunnel through the tissue are hyaluronidase - which helps them breaks down proteoglycans, staphylokinase - to break down fibrin clots, proteases - to break down proteins, and lipases - to break down lipids and fats. Lipases help staphylococci infect sebaceous glands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.drbeen.com/articles/Staphylococci/026.png\" style=\"height:563px; width:1025px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cytoplasmic Membrane</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The inner cytoplasmic membrane contains the <span class=\"marker\">penicillin binding proteins (PBP)</span>.&nbsp;Methicillin resistant bugs alter their penicillin binding proteins. This altered structure of the penicillin binding protein helps staphylococci resist penicillin. Note that these penicillin resistant pathogens become resistant to all beta lactam class of antibiotics. That is they resist penicillins, synthetic penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"marker\">Note that Staphylococci have to acquire mecA gene which helps them make the altered PBP.</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cell Wall</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Bacterial cell wall contains <span class=\"marker\">peptidoglycans</span>. This layer is synthesized by penicillin-binding-proteins that we just discussed above. Beta lactam drugs disrupt the normal function of the penicillin-binding-proteins, which results in incorrect peptidoglycan synthesis. This in turn causes breaks in the cell walls and the pathogen dies.&nbsp;Peptidoglycan layer also acts like an endotoxin.&nbsp;<span class=\"marker\">Teichoic acid and lipoteichoic acids</span> are attached to the peptidoglycan layer or the plasma membrane.&nbsp;These are poorly immunogenic and can trigger antibody response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.drbeen.com/articles/Staphylococci/027.png\" style=\"height:563px; width:1025px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><br />\r\nSurface adhesion proteins</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nA large number of such proteins are present. These proteins help bind staphylococci to foreign material like <span class=\"marker\">catheters, splinters, etc., and elastin, collagen, and fibrinogen</span> of the host tissues.<br />\r\n<span class=\"marker\">Coagulase</span> protein that is used to identify staphylococcus aureus is actually one of these surface adhesion proteins. It is also called a <span class=\"marker\">clumping factor</span> because it helps pathogen clump together.&nbsp;Coagulase binds to fibrinogen and converts it to insoluble fibrin.&nbsp;Another surface protein called <span class=\"marker\">protein A</span> binds with the Fc portion of immunoglobulin-G (IgG) and makes it unavailable to bind with phagocytes. This helps prevent opsonization of the pathogen and resulting phagocytosis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Remember antibody and complement coating on a pathogen marks it for the phagocytes to eat it up. This marking is called <span class=\"marker\">opsonization</span>.</em><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.drbeen.com/articles/Staphylococci/028.png\" style=\"height:563px; width:1025px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><br />\r\n<span class=\"marker\">Enzymes</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"marker\">Exfoliatin</span></strong> is an exotoxin that causes scalded skin syndrome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"marker\">Enterotoxin B</span></strong> causes food poisoning with vomiting and diarrhea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"marker\">Toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1)</span></strong> is a superantigen. It binds to MHC class II molecules on the antigen presenting cells (APCs). We will discuss this more separately, over here just a brief discussion. This binding of the TSST-1 to MHC-II causes massive release of interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin 2 (IL-2), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) from the immune cells. These cytokines in turn cause toxic shock.&nbsp;<span class=\"marker\">Tampons</span> left in place for long time can cause this toxic shock when S. Aureus grows in the area of tampons, penetrates the vaginal walls, and triggers the immune response discussed above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"marker\">Beta lactamases</span></strong>,&nbsp;these proteins are secreted by the pathogen to catch the penicillins outside the pathogen and prevent these penicillin molecules from entering the bug and killing it. Very smart of this bad boy or girl. What is the gender of staphylococci? Hmm? Let&rsquo;s know if you know...</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.drbeen.com/articles/Staphylococci/029.png\" style=\"height:563px; width:1025px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Important Considerations</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually <span class=\"marker\">early prosthetic infections</span> are caused by S. Aureus. Early means three months or lesser. <span class=\"marker\">Late prosthesis infections</span> are caused by S. Epi. And, late means greater than three months.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep in mind, S. Aureus and S. Epi are the <span class=\"marker\"><strong>most common healthcare related causes of infective endocarditis (IE).</strong></span>&nbsp;S. Epi usually causes right sided heart infection in <span class=\"marker\">IV drug abusers</span>.&nbsp;S. Aureus usually causes infection after <span class=\"marker\">vascular manipulation, especially cardiac catheters etc</span>. <strong><em>A clinical gem is that there may be pain at the point of entry of the catheter when the infection has occurred. It is not always the case though.</em></strong><br />\r\n<span class=\"marker\">Splenic abscesses</span> are mostly caused by Staphylococci, Streptococci, and Salmonella. So this bad bug is involved here as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.drbeen.com/articles/Staphylococci/030.png\" style=\"height:563px; width:1024px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><br />\r\nImportant Diagnostic Tests for Staphylococci</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As discussed earlier these are gram positive.&nbsp;These are also <span class=\"marker\">catalase positive</span>. Catalase enzyme converts H2O2 to H2O and Oxygen. Rubbing a wire loop on the colony and then dipping it in H2O2 will show bubbles when oxygen is produced.<br />\r\nStaphylococci are <span class=\"marker\">beta hemolytic</span> on blood agar culture.&nbsp;Staphylococci make <span class=\"marker\">golden colonies on sheep blood agar. Aureus means gold.</span> This is why S. Aureus is called Aureus.&nbsp;<br />\r\nStaphylococcus aureus is also <span class=\"marker\">coagulase positive</span>. Remember from our earlier discussion that coagulase is a surface adhesion protein present on S. Aureus. It converts fibrinogen to fibrin. Fibrin in turn helps build walls around the pathogens. Which makes it difficult to phagocytose.&nbsp;To test for the presence of coagulase put the pathogen in plasma. If plasma coagulates then the pathogens are coagulase positive. Remember coagulase positive pathogens are more virulent.&nbsp;Coagulase negative pathogens are usually less virulent.&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe know that S. Epi and S. Saprophyticus are both coagulase negative. How do we differentiate between them? Well, we do the novobiocin test.&nbsp;S. Epi is <span class=\"marker\">novobiocin sensitive</span>. While, S. Sap is not.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"marker\">Mannitol</span> is fermented by S. Aureus and is not by others.<br />\r\n<span class=\"marker\">7.5% NaCl</span> inhibits growth of most other pathogens but not Staphylococcus aureus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.drbeen.com/articles/Staphylococci/031.png\" style=\"height:563px; width:1025px\" /><br />\r\nHigh Level Management</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Penicllin Sensitive</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If the pathogens are <span class=\"marker\">not penicillin resistant</span>. Which unfortunately is a small number now a days -only 10%, then we can administer <span class=\"marker\">penicillin, or semisynthetic penicillins like methicillin, nafcillin, oxacillin, or dicloxacillin.&nbsp;</span><span class=\"marker\">Cephalosporins and carbapenem</span> will work too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Methicillin Resistant</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For the <span class=\"marker\">methicillin resistant species</span> which are the majority of the pathogens now a days, use the following approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For <span class=\"marker\">oral</span> medication the possible choices are <span class=\"marker\">sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX/TMP), or tetracyclines like doxycycline, clindamycin, minocycline, linezolid</span>.&nbsp;<br />\r\nFor the IV route <span class=\"marker\">Vancomycin</span> is the best choice. Alternatives to vancomycin for the IV route are <span class=\"marker\">daptomycin, tigecycline, and linezolid</span>.&nbsp;<em>Note vancomycin will cover both the penicillin sensitive and resistant pathogens.

As a result of this processing, small antigen pieces that are usually lipids are formed and packed in the vesicles called endosomes.&nbsp;APCs also have MHC II molecules formed in their rough endoplasmic reticulum. These molecules are made of alpha and beta chains. These chains have a peptide binding site where the antigen pieces are loaded. The peptide binding site is usually kept closed by the CLIP part of an invariant chain protein. This protein here is (labeled li). These complexes are packed in vesicles called exocytic vesicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Going back to the antigen processing, after an endosome is formed with the antigen pieces in it, it is fused with the exocytic vesicles that contain the MHC II complexes. Inside this fused vesicle the CLIP part of the li protein is cleaved to expose the antigen binding site on the MHC II complex. Once this site is available antigens from the endosomes are loaded in it.&nbsp;This antigen loaded MHC II complex is exposed on the cell surface to be recognized by the T cell receptors on the helper T cells.&nbsp;As a result, T cell receptors bind with this antigen loaded MHC II molecule.&nbsp;CD4 is also needed for a complete binding. As a result of this binding and costimulatory signals the T cell and the macrophage become active and the immune response starts. This is the normal mechanism. Let&rsquo;s now check how a superantigen causes this mechanism to become life threatening for us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Superantigen and Massive T Cell Activation Resulting in Cytokine Storm</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A superantigen binds to the MHC II complex without the need to be processed inside an APC. A superantigen can attach with any already available MHC II molecule on the APC surface.&nbsp;This superantigen also binds to T cell receptor without being specific to this receptor.&nbsp;This means a superantigen will bind with many helper T cells and activate them all.&nbsp;This activation of the T helper cells causes release of IFN-gamma. Which in turn causes macrophages to become active as well. Activated macrophages in turn release IL1, IL6, and TNF-alpha.&nbsp;This massive activation of many T helper cells and macrophages causes a cytokine storm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly a large number of us have antibodies to these superantigens, however, people that develop toxic shock syndrome seem to lack sufficient quantities of antibodies to these superantigens. As a result they are vulnerable to toxic shock syndrome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note, that superantigens do not care for a specific T cell, hence, these antigens activate a large number of T helper cells. This is why these antigens are called superantigens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We will discuss the CDC&rsquo;s guidelines and the causes of symptoms with management in detail in the lecture on toxic shock syndrome. It is sufficient to know in this lecture that there is severe hypotension, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgias, skin desquamation, and multiple organ failure. Death can occur within days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Labs</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s also take a quick look at the labs.&nbsp;Because of the tissue damage one might see the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Increased AST, ALT, and Bilirubin.</li>\r\n\t<li>Increased levels of creatine phosphokinase CPK</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n", "cmeTitle" : "Staphylococcus", "seq" : 8 },

Usually the focus is the <span class=\"marker\"><strong>severed umbilical cord</strong></span>, or an infected area of skin.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Pathology</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Staphylococcus aureus grows in the focus of infection and releases exotoxins named exfoliatin A and/or exfoliatin B.&nbsp;These toxins diffuse in the systemic circulation and cause scalded skin syndrome.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Exfoliatin A is encoded by ETA gene of a phage, while Exfoliatin B is mediated by a plasmid.</li>\r\n\t<li>Exfoliatin A is heat stable, i.e. it usually escapes boiling for 20 minutes.

They cause cleavage of the epidermis at the level of stratum <strong>spinosum</strong> (below the stratum granulosum and above the stratum spinosum) by dissolving the <strong>mucopolysaccharide</strong> matrix and breaking <strong>desmoglein-1</strong> in the desmosomes that bind the skin cells especially the cells in the epidermal layers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why does the patient has exfoliation of the skin instead of blisters?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In reality the cleavage of the epidermis does produce blisters. But the roof of this blister is very thin and fragile and it usually collapses. This is why you don&rsquo;t see blisters and <span class=\"marker\">instead peeling skin is observed</span>. This also is the reason why the <span class=\"marker\">child recovers without any scarring</span>.&nbsp;The skin peeling usually starts in one to two days at the groin, axilla and mouth and then spreads to the whole body.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Presentation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Child usually presents with</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Red tender and moist skin</li>\r\n\t<li>Fevr</li>\r\n\t<li>Irritability</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>You may be able to find the focus of infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Management</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Take <span class=\"marker\">swabs</span> from the focus of the infection if possible for culture and sensitivity. Also take a <span class=\"marker\">skin snip</span> for the histology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immediately start supportive therapy and antibiotics. Let&rsquo;s discuss what these therapies usually are.&nbsp;Administer oral antibiotics in case of local disease or parenteral in case of systemic disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Antibiotics</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Administration of semisynthetic penicillinase resistant penicillins like <strong>methicillin</strong>, <strong>nafcillin</strong>, <strong>dicloxacillin</strong>, <strong>flucloxacillin</strong> is indicated, however, if the pathogen is methicillin resistant then <strong>vancomycin</strong> is given.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quick note on penicillinase resistant and methicillin resistant antibiotics. Most staphylococci secrete penicillinase enzyme that breaks penicillins, however, flucloxacillin, methicillin and nafcillin like antibiotics are not broken down by this enzyme. Unfortunately, there are species of S. Aureus that have acquired a mecA gene to encode for an altered penicillin binding protein and render penicillinase resistant antibiotics mentioned above inactive because these antibiotics cannot bind and inactivate the penicillin binding proteins. These pathogens are labeled as MRSA. Vancomycin is needed for MRSA. Vancomycin binds to amino acids in the cell wall and prevent further addition thus preventing the cell wall formation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Flucloxacillin</strong> systemically. It is a&nbsp;penicillinase resistant penicillin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vancomycin</strong> can be used for&nbsp;MRSA (MRSA has modified penicillin binding protein.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Clindamycin</strong> maybe added to stop bacterial toxin production. (It is a protein synthesis inhibitor - used just like in toxic shock syndrome.)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Supportive Therapy</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Gently <strong>moisten</strong> the skin.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Emollients</strong> may help reduce the discomfort.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Topical</strong> <strong>antibiotics</strong> may be needed.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Hydroxyzine</strong> 2 mg/ml - 2.5 ml every 6h PRN (when needed) for pruritus.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Mupirocin</strong> in nostrils 3x a day for 7 days.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Erythromycin</strong> <strong>eye</strong> <strong>ointment</strong> - 1 strip to both lower eyelids 2x daily.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Cloxacillin</strong> (penicillinase resistant penicillin.) 2 mg/ml - 2 ml every 6 h on empty stomach.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Family Members Should be Tested for the Carrier State</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Take groin, axilla and mouth swabs from the family members to figure out pathogen&nbsp;carriage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Reducing the Recurrence</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ask to use antibacterial hand washing soaps to prevent further infections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Recovery</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Recovery is usually fast with no scarring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "seq" : 6 },

We have already discussed the diseases caused by staphylococcal <span class=\"marker\">exotoxins,</span>&nbsp;let&#39;s now discuss&nbsp;the diseases that are caused by staphylococcal&nbsp;organ invasion. The first disease is staphylococcal infective endocarditis.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is Infective Endocarditis (IE)?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Infection anywhere in the heart is called endocarditis. Valves, septal defects&nbsp;(more commonly ventricular septal defects,) chordae tendineae, mural endocardium i.e. the posterior wall of the left atrium, etc. are commonly involved tissues.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Terms</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we start the discussion, a quick review of the terms related to IE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Of course infective endocarditis is usually abbreviated as <strong>IE</strong>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Native Valve Endocarditis (NVE)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If the infection is of the native valves, that is, the valves that we are born with, then the endocarditis is called native valve endocarditis and is written as <strong>NVE</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis (PVE)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Infections of the artificial valves, also called prosthetic valves, are called prosthetic valve endocarditis. Prosthetic valve endocarditis is usually&nbsp;abbreviated as <strong>PVE</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Nosocomical Infective Endocarditis (NIE)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Endocarditis acquired in the hospitals due to medical attention or invasive procedures are called nosocomial infective endocarditis and abbreviated as <strong>NIE</strong>.&nbsp;Keep in mind that the invasive procedures that can cause bacteremia can lead to infective endocarditis.&nbsp;Examples are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Dental procedures</li>\r\n\t<li>Urogenital procedures</li>\r\n\t<li>Gastrointestinal procedures</li>\r\n\t<li>Cardiac surgery</li>\r\n\t<li>Peripheral or central intravascular catheterization</li>\r\n\t<li>Surgical incisions through the mucous membranes or infected skin.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"marker\">Nosocomial endocarditis is usually defined as the endocarditis occurring within 72 hours of hospitalization or within 8 weeks after an invasive procedure.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Community Acquired Infective Endocarditis (CIE)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Community acquired endocarditis is abbreviated as <strong>CIE</strong>. Some possible causes of CIE are <span class=\"marker\">chronic rheumatic heart disease, or congenital heart abnormalities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is The Composition of An Infective Endocarditis Vegetation?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Endocarditis causes vegetations in the heart that are composed of <span class=\"marker\">fibrin, platelets, pathogens, and inflammatory cells.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.drbeen.com/articles/Staphylococci/IMG_0593.JPG\" style=\"height:588px; width:800px\" /></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>What are The Types of Infective Endocarditis?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Infective endocarditis is divided in two basic types:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Acute endocarditis</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It&nbsp;is caused by coagulase positive staphylococcus and progresses rapidly within days to weeks. <span class=\"marker\">Acute endocarditis does not need pre existing damage to the heart.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Subacute Infective Endocarditis</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Develops slowly usually in weeks to months. Many organisms can cause subactuve infective endocarditis. Some pathogens that can cause subacute infective endocarditis are&nbsp;coagulase negative staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus viridans, enterococcus, fungi, and gram negative pathogens. Subacute infective endocarditis&nbsp;can be polymicrobial as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Tissues of The Heart Are Most Susceptible to Infective Endocarditis?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally any part of the heart tissue that is under stress can have endocardial damage. Platelets and fibrin accumulate on&nbsp;the damaged endothelium and form a plaque. This plaque in turn is an attractive place for the pathogens to stick to. Local damage causes&nbsp;inflammatory reaction to start. This components&nbsp;form an infected vegetation.&nbsp;This is the reason that a much bigger but low pressure atrial septal defect with significant hemodynamic consequences does not develop infective endocarditis, while&nbsp;a&nbsp;smaller,&nbsp;high pressure ventricular septal defect that is&nbsp;hemodynamically&nbsp;insignificant can develop infective endocarditis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.drbeen.com/articles/Staphylococci/IMG_0594.JPG\" style=\"height:588px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commonly infected tissues are aortic valve, mitral valve, chordae tendineae, and ventricular septal defects. In the IV drug abusers tricuspid valve is most commonly involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember,&nbsp;vegetations that develop can become obstructive or emboli.</p>\r\n", "seq" : 4 },

(10%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"marker\">Janeway&#39;s lesions</span> are painless, erythematous lesions on palms and soles. Keep in mind that <span class=\"marker\">Osler&rsquo;s nodes</span> are painful. Janeway lesions are painless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spleen and kidney infarcts. Even hematuria due to the renal damage from emboli.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Post Infective Immune Complex Disease Related Symptoms</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Immunologic phenomena develops due to immune complex depositions in varioius tissues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"marker\">Osler&#39;s nodes</span> are tender (painful) raised lesions on the <span class=\"marker\">finger or toe pads</span>. These lesions are due to immune complex deposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"marker\">Roth&rsquo;s spots</span>,&nbsp;are rounded white spots on retina surrounded by hemorrhage. Usually caused by immune complex mediated vasculitis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Postinfective immune complex based glomerulonephritis.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Diagnosis</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Modified duke&rsquo;s criteria</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Duke&rsquo;s criteria is divided into <span class=\"marker\">major and minor clinical, pathological, and microbiological factors</span>. These factors are as follows.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Duke&rsquo;s Major Criteria</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Duke&rsquo;s major criteria includes the following <strong>blood culture</strong> related findings:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Two positive blood cultures.</li>\r\n\t<li>Persistent positive blood cultures taken more than 12 hours apart.</li>\r\n\t<li>Three or more positive blood cultures taken more than 1 hour apart each.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Duke&rsquo;s major criteria includes following <strong>endocardial involvement</strong> related findings:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Positive echo that is findings of vegetations on echo.</li>\r\n\t<li>New valvular regurgitation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Duke&#39;s Minor Criteria</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Duke&rsquo;s Minor criteria includes following factors</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Predisposing valvular or cardiac abnormality</li>\r\n\t<li>Intravenous drug misuse</li>\r\n\t<li>Pyrexia &ge; 38&deg;C or 100.4&deg;F</li>\r\n\t<li>Embolic phenomenon</li>\r\n\t<li>Vasculitic phenomenon</li>\r\n\t<li>Blood cultures suggestive: organism grown but not achieving major criteria</li>\r\n\t<li>Suggestive echocardiographic ﬁndings</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Evaluating Infective Endocarditis Diagnosis Based on the Modified Duke&#39;s Criteria</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Definitive Endocarditis</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Definitive endocarditis&nbsp;is when 2 major or 1 major and 3 minor, or 5 minor factors are found.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Possible Endocarditis</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Possible endocarditis is when one major and one minor or three minor factors are found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the next lecture, we will discuss the approach to the management of the acute infective endocarditis.</p>\r\n", "seq" : 3 },

Current topic is the management approaches to acute infective endocarditis or staphylococcal endocarditis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>General Principles</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Bactericidal therapy is necessary in infective endocarditis.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Dose the antibiotic administration in a way to create a continuous antimicrobial concentration in patient&rsquo;s serum.</li>\r\n\t<li>Perform the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test repeatedly.</li>\r\n\t<li>If the patient is not acutely ill, and you suspect that patient may have acute infective endocarditis then it is preferable to wait for the&nbsp;blood culture&nbsp;and sensitivity.</li>\r\n\t<li>Acutely ill patients with signs and symptoms of the acute infective endocarditis should be started on empirical therapy while you wait for the cultures. Once the culture result has arrived then adjust the therapy according to the identified pathogen and sensitivity.</li>\r\n\t<li>Duration of the therapy is usually six weeks. Remember duration is counted from the day the blood culture becomes negative (provided that it was positive when the therapy started.)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Management Approach</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>With these considerations, let&rsquo;s look at the management approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss empiric therapy first.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Empiric Therapy</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Basic principles of the empiric therapy are following:</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Therapy should cover the most common pathogens known to cause the infective endocarditis. These include Staphylococci both methicillin susceptible (MSSA) and methicillin resistant (MRSA), Streptococci, and Enterococci.</li>\r\n\t<li>Empiric therapy should be started after 2 to 3 positive blood cultures from different venipunctures obtained at intervals of 30 to 60 minutes.</li>\r\n\t<li>Safest route for empiric therapy is to start with Vancomycin, 15 to 20 mg/kg of body weight administered every 8 to 12 hours. Keep in mind that a single dose should not exceed 2 g.</li>\r\n\t<li>Consult a cardiac surgeon early in case of suspected complications like prosthetic valves or heart failure.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Definitive Therapy for&nbsp;Staphylococcus Aureus</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s now look at staph aureus focused definitive therapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Keep in mind that vancomycin is less effective against staphylococci compared to beta lactams. So beta lactams are preferable over vancomycin if the pathogen is sensitive to them.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Also remember that a reasonable alternative to vancomycin is daptomycin. Dose is 6 mg/kg of body weight, IV, daily.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at the possible therapy if the pathogen is methicillin resistant or is coagulase negative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vancomycin</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>AHA recommends against adding <strong>rifampin</strong> to <strong>vancomycin</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t combine <strong>vancomycin</strong> with <strong>gentamicin</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the pathogen is <strong>methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus</strong> (MSSA) then the antimicrobial approach is the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the following beta lactam drugs can be administered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nafcillin</strong> in the dose of 2 g IV every four hours</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or <strong>Oxacillin</strong> &nbsp;2 g IV every four hours</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or <strong>Flucloxacillin</strong> 2 g IV every six hours</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "seq" : 2 },

Aureus.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We are continuing our discussion about the diseases caused by staphylococcal organ invasion. Today is the turn for the staphylococcal skin infections. We will discuss impetigo, furuncles or boils, carbuncles, and cellulitis. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome caused by exotoxin is already discussed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of these infections occur after a break in the skin. The infection spreads when the patient touches, scratches, or when the dressing from the wound is touched. This is why it is important to wash hands after touching the infected areas of skin and also equally important is to dispose-off the dressings carefully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Folliculitis</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Folliculitis is the name given to a group of skin conditions in which there are inflamed hair follicles. The result is a tender red spot, often with a surface pustule. Folliculitis may be superficial or deep and can affect any hair-bearing area of skin.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>A furuncle (syn. boil) is a deeper, and more pronounced infection of the hair follicle in which purulent material extends through the dermis into the subcutaneous tissue, where a small abscess forms. A carbuncle is a coalescence of several inflamed follicles into a single inflammatory mass with purulent drainage from multiple follicles.  \r\nhttp://www.pcds.org.uk/clinical-guidance/folliculitis-an-overview\r\n</code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s summarize these infections before we&nbsp;dive deeper. <strong>Impetigo</strong> is the infection of the superficial layers or epidermis of the skin. <strong>Folliculitis</strong> is the infection of a single hair follicle. <strong>Furuncle</strong> or a boil is a folliculitis that is more pronounced and spills over to the neighboring tissue especially extending through the dermis to the deeper subcutaneous tissue. When many furuncles are near each other and communicate with each other, then these are called a <strong>carbuncle</strong>. And, finally, <strong>cellulitis</strong> is the non-suppurative infection of the deeper tissue mostly involving deep dermis and subcutaneous layers. Let us now discuss these conditions and their management one by one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Impetigo</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a highly contagious infection of the superficial skin layers. It occurs mostly in infants and children. Most commonly it starts under the nose as small vesicles that break and crust over. This honey-colored crust or scab is made of dried serum. Scab is removed leaving a red mark that soon resolves without any scarring.&nbsp;Impetigo can spread in hot and humid climates. Also, note that if there are areas of skin burns or skin breaks, then impetigo can spread into these areas causing cellulitis.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tests and labs</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A pus swab is taken for culture on blood agar or chocolate agar.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Mild infections should be treated with topical mupirocin or fusidic acid.</li>\r\n\t<li>Remove crusts with topical antiseptics, water, and soap.</li>\r\n\t<li>The staphylococcal nasal carriage should be treated as well. Use chlorhexidine with neomycin for this purpose. Chronic, recurrent, and resistant cases may need treatment with mupirocin nasal ointment. Usually administered in the nares for ten days.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s talk now about the localized skin infections that are furuncles/boils, carbuncles, and cellulitis.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Furuncles or Boils</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Recall that folliculitis is the infection of a single hair follicle. When this infection becomes pronounced and spills out of the follicle into deeper layers, then it is called a <strong>furuncle</strong>.&nbsp;Usually, furuncles occur in youngsters and males. Most common locations are the neck, shoulders, and anogenital areas.&nbsp;Furuncles repeatedly occur in people that are Staphylococcus aureus carriers. Tight clothes causing skin friction leading to hair follicle injury and skin breaks can cause furuncles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Carbuncles</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Many nearby furuncles that communicate with each other are called carbuncles. Carbuncles develop dome-shaped, skin lesions that are very painful, and mostly have purulent discharge.&nbsp;Diabetic and immunosuppressed patients are especially at risk. Additionally, poor hygiene, malnourishment, addiction, heart failure, other skin diseases, and prolonged steroid therapy can lead to carbuncles as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the furuncles and carbuncles can be treated with the following therapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Flucloxacillin for S. Aureus and Penicillin for Strep pyogenes. Erythromycin or clarithromycin in case of penicillin sensitivity. One week therapy is sufficient in acute cases. Chronic cases may need two-week therapy with nasal carriage treatment.</li>\r\n\t<li>For carbuncles, surgical incision and drainage may be needed.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cellulitis</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Cellulitis is a non-suppurative deeper tissue infection.&nbsp;Non-suppurative means there is no discharge.&nbsp;Overlying skin looks hot, red, shiny, and swollen.&nbsp;<strong>An important clinical point to note is that any suspicion of mid-facial cellulitis should be immediately treated otherwise cavernous sinus thrombosis can occur.</strong>&nbsp;Cellulitis can be caused by S. Aureus, Streptococci or Clostridium perfringens.&nbsp;You might see <strong>systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) symptoms</strong>. For example, tachycardia, tachypnea, increased or reduced temperature, leukocytosis, or leukopenia. Also fever, chills, rigors may also be present.&nbsp;A bacterial sample for culture is usually difficult to obtain, a punch biopsy of the tissue may be useful.&nbsp;Make sure to rule out bone infections and necrotizing fasciitis before diagnosing cellulitis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Surgical Wound Infections</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s quickly discuss the last type of skin infection by S.

Make sure that you have understood this before the second part about the diseases and their management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this lecture we will discuss the following topics:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Virulence potential</li>\r\n\t<li>Habitat\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Throat</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Skin</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Tests\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Erythrogenic/Pyogenic exotoxin</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Gram +</li>\r\n\t\t<li>PYR +</li>\r\n\t\t<li>RAD</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Catalase -</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Bacitracin sensitive</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Antigenic components of the cell wall\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Hyaluronic acid</li>\r\n\t\t<li>C carbs</li>\r\n\t\t<li>M Proteins</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Exotoxins</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Enzymes\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Streptolysin O</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Streptolysin S</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Streptokinase</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Hyaluronidase</li>\r\n\t\t<li>DNAse</li>\r\n\t\t<li>C5a Peptidase</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThese foundations will be used to look at the disease process, disease types, and the disease management in the next lecture.</p>\r\n", "notes" : "<h2>Introduction</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In this lecture, we will discuss the clinically important points related to&nbsp;streptococcus pyogenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Streptococcus pyogenes</strong> is the <span class=\"marker\">most virulent pathogen of all streptococci</span>.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It is a beta-hemolytic pathogen. That is, it causes complete lysis of red blood cells.</li>\r\n\t<li>It also is bacitracin sensitive. Remember the other pathogen in this group, that is, streptococcus agalactiae are bacitracin resistant.</li>\r\n\t<li>And, finally, Streptococcus pyogenes is PYR +</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>By the way, the word pyogenes means pus-producing. You will see that this pathogen <span class=\"marker\">causes tissue liquefaction</span> resulting in pus formation. A little later in this lecture, you will read&nbsp;the enzymes that help break down tissues to allow this pathogen to spread.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Habitat</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Streptococcus pyogenes is the normal flora of our throat and skin.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Structure</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hyaluronic Acid Capsule</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This capsule is antiphagocytic.&nbsp;Hyaluronic acid in the capsule binds to CD44 or hyaluronic acid binding protein on our epithelium. This binding leads to the disruption of intracellular junctions, breaking the cell to cell adhesion. This mechanism&nbsp;separates the cells creating a path for the pathogen to penetrate deeper in the tissue without becoming intracellular.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cell Wall</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>C Carbohydrates</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>C carbohydrates were used by Rebecca Lancefield for Streptococcal classification. The C carbohydrate on strep pyogenes is of type A. This is why we label <span class=\"marker\">streptococcus pyogenes as group A pathogen.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>M Proteins</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important component of the cell wall is the M protein. This protein is antigenic. In the capsular strains of the streptococci, it protrudes from the capsule forming little <span class=\"marker\">pili</span>. These pili are also covered by lipoteichoic acid. M protein is important because <span class=\"marker\">it inactivates the alternate complement pathway activation, preventing phagocytosis.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>M proteins, however, is also <span class=\"marker\">the weakest part of the pathogen</span>. Our B cells make anti-M protein antibodies that opsonize the pathogen by attaching to the M proteins. Once opsonized, the pathogen can now be easily cleared away by the phagocytes and neutrophils that bind to the Fc part of the antibodies and pick up this pathogen and destroy it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I find it funny that on one end the M protein destroys complement to prevent phagocytosis, but then our immune system coats them with the antibodies, making them yummy for our phagocytic cells, that phagocytose the pathogen. Immune system 1, streptococci 0. Take-that streptococci!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Enzymes</h2>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong><big>Note: Streptococci have many enzymes that are similar to staphylococci in their function. Hence, many infections are similar too.&nbsp;And, this is why usually for the skin infections you will give treatment that covers both streptococci and staphylococci.</big></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Important enzymes are, <span class=\"marker\">Streptolysin O, Streptolysin S, Streptokinase, Hyaluronidase, DNAse A, B, C, and D; and C5a peptidase</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Streptolysin O&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember O in streptolysin O stands for <span class=\"marker\">oxygen labile</span>. This enzyme is a <strong>hemolysin</strong>. That is it destroys blood by destroying red and white blood cells. This enzyme is also <strong>antigenic</strong>. We produce antibodies against it which can be measured to identify recent infection. <span class=\"marker\">This antibody is called anti-streptolysin-O or ASO. You will routinely order ASO titers in the wards. Usually, 160 to 200 units are significant.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Streptolysin S&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>S in streptolysin S stands for <span class=\"marker\">oxygen stabile</span>. This enzyme is also hemolysin and takes part in breaking RBCs and WBCs. However, remember, <span class=\"marker\">it is not antigenic.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Streptokinase&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Streptokinase helps activate plasmin from plasminogen. Plasmin, in turn, breaks fibrin in the clots. This, in turn, <span class=\"marker\">helps the pathogen escape clots.</span>&nbsp;Due to&nbsp;this property&nbsp;<span class=\"marker\">streptokinase is also used in the hospital wards during MIs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hyaluronidase&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It splits hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid is an important part of the ground substance of the connective tissue. This enzyme helps streptococci <span class=\"marker\">break the tissue to invade and spread</span>. This tissue liquefaction also results in pus formation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>DNAses</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are four types of DNAses that streptococci produce, <span class=\"marker\">DNAse A,B,C, and D</span>. As the name suggests, these enzymes also help break down the tissue to allow the bacteria to spread. <strong>Anti DNAse B antibodies are produced by our immune system. These antibodies can be measured to confirm a recent streptococcal infection.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>C5a Peptidase&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This enzyme <span class=\"marker\">breaks the C5a protein resulting in chemotaxis prevention</span>. This in turn delays the immune response and allows the pathogen to establish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Exotoxins, diseases, and their management in the next lecture.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "seq" : 11 },

Delusions are false beliefs, such as thinking that someone is plotting against you or that the TV is sending you secret messages. Hallucinations are false perceptions, such as hearing, seeing, or feeling something that is not there. Schizophrenia is one type of psychotic disorder. Psychosis can also be caused by alcohol, some drugs, brain tumours, brain infections, stroke and mood disorders such as bipolar.

You will see patients with strep throat frequently. In the US alone, strep throat causes seven million medical visits yearly. It usually spreads from person to person by saliva or nasal secretions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tissue Binding</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Streptococcus pyogenes adheres to the fibronectin on pharyngeal epithelium by the lipoteichoic acid covering the pili. Another way that the streptococcus pyogenes binds to our epithelium is by the hyaluronic acid capsule binding with CD44 of our epithelial cells.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Presentation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In small children, there is thin serous discharge, little fever, and possibly infection spreading to the middle ear and mastoid.&nbsp;Cervical lymph nodes are usually enlarged.&nbsp;This disease is more intense in older children and adults, characterized by intense tonsillitis, nasopharyngitis, and edema with purulent exudate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CDC recommends Penicillin in non-allergic patients.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Penicillin V children 250 mg twice or thrice daily, adults 250 mg four times daily or 500 mg twice daily. For 10 days.</li>\r\n\t<li>Or Amoxicillin 50 mg/kg once daily (max 1000 mg) for 10 days.</li>\r\n\t<li>Benzathine Penicillin G IM. 1 dose. &lt; 27 kg 60,000 Units, &gt; 27 kg 120,000 units.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>For individuals with penicillin allergy</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Cephalexin,a oral&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;20 mg/kg/dose twice daily (max = 500 mg/dose)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;10 days</li>\r\n\t<li>Cefadroxil,a oral&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;30 mg/kg once daily (max = 1 g)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;10 days</li>\r\n\t<li>Clindamycin, oral&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;7 mg/kg/dose 3 times daily (max = 300 mg/dose)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;10 days</li>\r\n\t<li>Azithromycin,b oral&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;12 mg/kg once daily (max = 500 mg)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5 days</li>\r\n\t<li>Clarithromycinb, oral&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;7.5 mg/kg/dose twice daily (max = 250 mg/dose)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;10 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Streptococcal skin infections</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Skin infections by the streptococcus pyogenes range from the infection of a hair follicle called folliculitis to deep tissue infections called cellulitis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the skin infections caused by streptococci can also be caused by staphylococci. <span class=\"marker\">Hence, the treatment should have antibiotics that cover both pathogens, for example, penicillinase-resistant penicillins like dicloxacillin.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Streptococcus pyogenes cellulitis</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Streptococci cellulitis is the infection of deeper skin layers. Usually, the overlying tissue appears, red, hot, and mildly swollen. However, note this carefully, that it is not easy to determine the boundary between the healthy and the infected tissue.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Erysipelas</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Streptococci also cause erysipelas which is rarely caused by staphylococci. Erysipelas is the infection of superficial skin layers. It is characterized by an area of swollen skin with a clear boundary. This infection is routinely seen on a patient&rsquo;s face and can involve the ears as well. Remember that ears are made of superficial skin layers. This is why erysipelas can infect them because erysipelas infects superficial skin layers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Pyoderma/Pustules</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the skin infection often seen on the extremities and the face. It breaks down in a few days leaving a crust that heals slowly. There is an area of depigmentation at the location of the pustule.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Exotoxin Mediated Diseases</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Three diseases in this class are important, scarlet fever, toxic shock-like syndrome, and necrotizing fasciitis.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Scarlet Fever</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Scarlet fever is mediated by the pyrogenic or erythrogenic exotoxin. Patient has a scarlet red rash that begins on the trunk and neck and then spreads to the extremities. This erythematous rash &nbsp;blanches on pressure. This rash also has a sandpaper quality and is accentuated in the flexor creases. Palms, soles, and face are usually spare. Face is flushed and looks red, but this is not the rash. There is also a characteristic pallor around the mouth called circumoral pallor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember that the exotoxin is acquired by the lysogenic conversion. Lysogenic conversion is where a gene from one bacteria gets incorporated into a phage that carries this gene into another bacteria providing this next bacteria with the new capability by this incoming gene. In case of Streptococcus pyogenes, a phage can bring the gene for the pyrogenic or erythrogenic exotoxin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatment for the pathogen is the same as described for pharyngitis above.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Toxic Shock Syndrome</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Pain is the most common presentation. Usually involves an extremity but may mimic peritonitis, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, pericarditis, etc. Some patients may even have influenza-like symptoms of fever, chills, nausea, diarrhea, myalgia, etc.There may be signs of tissue infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On admission to hospital patients are usually in shock and renal dysfunction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the complexity of a toxic shock, presenting a good treatment approach here is impossible. Having said that, Penicillin and Clindamycin are the drugs that can be used in addition to other medications to support the toxic shock patient. Some researchers have shown that clindamycin is more potent in TSS than penicillin due to its strong suppression of the bacterial toxin synthesis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/1/3/95-0301_article\">https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/1/3/95-0301_article</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Necrotizing Fasciitis</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Streptococcus strain that can cause necrotizing fasciitis is also called flesh-eating streptococcus.&nbsp;Bacteria enter through a skin breach which may have occurred due to trauma, burn, or surgery. M protein helps prevent phagocytosis while the hyaluronic acid capsule binds with the CD44 of the cells disrupting the intracellular adhesions. This leads to the ability of the pathogen to penetrate deep and infect the fascia.&nbsp;You may be wondering why this disease is toxin-mediated? The reason is that it is the toxin that starts the process of apoptosis in the cells leading to necrosis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within 24 hours the patient develops swelling, heat, and redness of the area infected. Another day later the skin color changes from red to purple to blue.&nbsp;Large bullae form. Finally, the skin dies and myositis may occur as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Treatment</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This infection should be rapidly recognized and fascia surgically removed. Additionally, penicillin and clindamycin are given in high doses. Remember clindamycin blocks streptococcal metabolism reducing the toxin and enzyme production.&nbsp;Even with the surgery and antibiotics, the mortality rate is greater than fifty percent &gt; 50%.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Immunologic diseases.</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Rheumatic Fever</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With the advent of antibiotics, rheumatic fever is less common nowadays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This disease occurs after streptococcal pharyngitis, however, it does not occur after streptococcal skin infections. Keep in mind that the second immunogenic disease is post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis which can occur after streptococcal pharyngitis or skin infections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we already know that streptococcal M proteins are antigenic. Our immune system develops anti M proteins antibodies. Unfortunately, our heart tissue also have proteins that look like M proteins. This results in the newly formed antibodies to attack or cross-react with the cardiac tissue resulting in the cardiac valve and heart muscle damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually, the mitral valve is damaged first. To remember this, note the M protein and M for the mitral valve. The aortic valve is damaged next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The immune cross-reaction occurs within 1 to 5 weeks of the original infection. Mean duration is 19 days after the infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patient presents with fever, malaise, joint pains, and the evidence of damage to the heart valves, muscles, or even pericardium. Following mnemonic should help you remember the presenting complaints.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>JONES Mnemonic</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>J</strong> for Joints. Patient complaints of migratory joint pains. Luckily there is no long-term joint damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>O</strong> for the heart. Evidence of cardiac valve, and muscle damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>N</strong> for nodules. There are subcutaneous, painless, rubbery nodules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>E</strong> for erythema marginatum. A red rash with a margin. It spreads out from its center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>S</strong> for Sydenham&#39;s chorea or involuntary movements due to neurologic issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"marker\">In the patients of RF, prophylactic penicillin is required for life of the patient to prevent future beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections and further cardiac damage.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Post-streptococcal Glomerulonephritis</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis can occur about a week after the streptococcal throat or skin infection.&nbsp;This disease is also immunogenic. Streptococcal antigens and antibody complexes are formed. These complexes tumble around and finally deposit in the glomeruli resulting in the immune reaction at the glomeruli and renal damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The patient usually presents with a puffy face and tea or coca-cola colored urine. On examination, you will find the patient is hypertensive due to hypervolemia from water retention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This disease has a good prognosis and a majority of the patients recover completely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the time patient presents to you the damage to the kidney is done. Treatment is usually supportive. However, if you decide to admit the patient then the discharge is indicated when diuresis starts and the blood pressure returns to normal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n" },

Catatonia can also be idiopathic, arising from an unknown cause. Any general medical patient who displays obvious related symptoms may be catatonic.
